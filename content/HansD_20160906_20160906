							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="BeginningOfDay"><strong>TUESDAY, 6 SEPTEMBER 2016</strong></p><p class="a"><a name="time_14:00:00" ></a><strong>Mr Speaker</strong> took the Chair at 2 p.m.</p><p class="a"><strong>Prayers</strong>.</p><p class="QOA"><strong>ORAL QUESTIONS</strong></p><p class="QType"><strong>QUESTIONS TO MINISTERS</strong></p><h4 class="QSubjectHeading"><strong>Housing—</strong><strong>Dwelling Consents</strong></h4><p class="SubsQuestion"><strong>1. </strong><strong>ANDREW LITTLE (Leader</strong><strong> of the Opposition</strong><strong>)</strong> to the <strong>Prime Minister</strong>: Does he stand by his statement that "we are seeing a record number of houses being built", given the current rate of dwelling consents per 1,000 New Zealanders is less than the average under the previous Labour Government, and less than half the record level?</p><p class="SubsAnswer"><a name="time_20160906 14:04:36" ></a><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY (Prime Minister)</strong>: It is relieving to see the member today with his clothes on. And the answer to that question is, yes.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: Don't be jealous, John.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I know! I was in awe—shock and awe.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! Now, we will get back to questions for oral answer.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: According to the latest Building Activity Survey from Statistics New Zealand, the amount of residential building work in the 3 months to July was the highest since the series began back in the 1980s. That is up 6 percent on the previous record level, set in March this year. It is an increase of 50 percent since 2013 and an increase of over 90 percent since the start of 2012. As I said previously, building consents have been running at the highest level for over 11 years, and we are looking for them to increase further.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: Will he take responsibility for fewer than 10,000 houses a year being built in Auckland when 13,000 are needed?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: There are a number of reasons why house numbers have not met the level that is required. Most of those reasons have been around the metropolitan urban limit restrictions, but also the global financial crisis had a big impact on developers not being in the position to be able to fulfil building plans. The good news is that we are narrowing that gap rapidly, and, under very low interest rates and a strong economy, more and more New Zealanders are buying a home.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: Are enough affordable houses being built in New Zealand today; if not, what excuse does he have after 8 long years?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: There are a range of houses being built across New Zealand, at a range of different prices. One looks at the KiwiSaver HomeStart programme—around the regions, that is being used by a great many New Zealanders. We think it will benefit over 90,000. But even as of the recent data today, over 30 percent of all sales that took place in Auckland in the last 12 months were at $650,000 or less.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: In light of information out today showing that the average house price in Auckland is now over $1 million, just how serious is he about getting more New Zealanders into an affordable home?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: The honourable member answered that himself when he noted the big increase in the number of properties being built under the National-led Government. Yes, it is less than what is probably required, but we are getting very close to getting that number delivered each year. If one looks at the Government's comprehensive plan, it is everything from releasing public land to extra people being trained in the sector. We are in the biggest building boom we have seen, and this is the largest number of people ever employed in the construction sector. There are more houses to be built, but this Government is helping to assist those houses to be built.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: What excuses does he make to Aucklander JP van der Westhuizen, who says: "My wife and I have got good jobs and earn decent money, especially for our age. … It's a vicious cycle, rent is so high that you can't save. The whole DIY Kiwi dream is becoming more and more unachievable. It's pretty ridiculous."?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: That would not be borne out by the number of people who are using KiwiSaver HomeStart, which is for first-home buyers. Secondly, what is happening is that, of course, you do have house prices going up in both Auckland and generally around New Zealand, but that is fuelled by extremely low interest rates and also a very buoyant economy. We have one of the fastest-growing economies in the developed world, the second-highest employment rate in the world, and one of the lowest unemployment rates.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: Does he accept that the reason 10,000 Kiwi kids under 15 are now homeless is that he and his Government have failed to fix the housing crisis?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I do not accept the premise of the member's question.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: I seek leave to table a table that shows the result of the Otago University research, showing that 10,000 children under 15 are now homeless.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! Can I just understand—the source of the document is an Otago University research document?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: That is correct.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: And has it been publicly released by the university?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: I am not aware of how it has been published, because I have got only a hard copy at this point. [<em>Interruption</em>]</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! I would advise members in the future that they will be asked that question and I will expect them to be ready. But on the basis that it has not been checked, leave has been sought to table that particular report. Is there any objection? There is none. It can be tabled.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: Will any of the excuses he has offered today help a single family buy their first home or help even one homeless child into a warm, safe home tonight?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Well, the number of houses being built both in Auckland and around New Zealand has been dramatically increasing in the time since I have been Prime Minister, from 10 a day to well over 40 a day. Just today the Government announced that there will be an additional $24 million going to support community housing providers. There was $50 million allocated in the Budget for emergency support. This is the Government that raised benefits for the first time in 43 years. This is the Government that also allocates over $2 billion a year to accommodation supplements and the like. I think the argument saying that we are not doing anything to help less-well-off New Zealanders simply does not hold water.</p></div></body>

I can think of an Indian person who came to New Zealand 44 years ago, set up a business, employed 200 people, and, from time to time, made donations—forgettable or not—to political parties that they thought about. That is all as a result of migration, funnily enough, from India. [<em>Interruption</em>] </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! The House on my right-hand side will settle.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong>: How sane is an immigrant who would offer $20,000 to have breakfast with him and—[<em>Interruption</em>]</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! Again, I am asking, for a second time, for a little more respect from my right-hand corner.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong>: —is he aware of Operation Silver Needle by Immigration New Zealand in Mumbai in November 2014, which found that 90 percent of the applicants were not bona fide and that such organised fraud continues to tarnish our export education reputation?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: In answer to the first part of the question, very. And in answer to the second part of the question, no.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong>: Why did he say that his Government is "working for all New Zealanders" when we currently have 15,000 unemployed New Zealand labourers whilst his Government approved work visas for 6,500 foreign labourers?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Most of that is because of mismatch of labour, so it is required in one part of the country and people are located in the other, or—as I said yesterday on <em>Morning Report</em>—people have a variety of reasons, from being unable to pass a drugs test, or a variety of other factors. So of course Work and Income does everything it can to get people in work, and one of the major changes this Government made was to re-face, if you like, the way Work and Income operates to get rid of the old dole and to replace it with job seeker support, and that has been highly effective.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong>: How is his Government working for all New Zealanders when his Government has approved dog handlers and dance teachers and over 10,000 chefs—more than the restaurants we have got in this country—as skilled migrants whilst we have 70,000 New Zealand youth not in employment, education, or training?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: There is nothing wrong with bringing in chefs, particularly if they are Indian. For some people, it can be very lucrative.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><h4 class="QSubjectheadingalone"><strong>Income Tax and Support Systems—</strong><strong>Redistribution</strong></h4><p class="SubsQuestion"><strong>3. </strong><strong>Dr SHANE RETI (National—Whangarei)</strong> to the <strong>Minister of Finance</strong>: How is redistribution through the income tax and income support systems helping support New Zealand families?</p><p class="SubsAnswer"><a name="time_20160906 14:15:24" ></a><strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE (Acting Minister of Finance)</strong>: Tax and income support is a significant source of income redistribution in the economy, more so following tax changes made in 2010. Treasury has updated its estimates for tax collection for the 2016-17 year. It now expects households earning over $140,000—that is, the top 20 percent of household incomes—will pay 55 percent of all income tax. The top 10 percent of households are expected to pay 37.2 percent of income tax this year, which is up from 35.5 percent when this Government took office in 2008. Families in lower-income households are paying a smaller proportion of tax. The 20 percent of households with the lowest income are expected to pay just 2.8 percent of income tax this year, compared with 3.4 percent in 2008.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Dr Shane Reti</strong>: What other evidence has he seen showing the tax and income support systems are more progressive today than in 2008?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE</strong>: Treasury has also undertaken an analysis of the net tax paid by households—that is income tax paid, less than the amount received in benefits, superannuation, and Working for Families. This shows the 30 percent of households with the lowest incomes will pay $1.7 billion of income tax, but this is more than offset by the $10.6 billion they are expected to receive in income support. Treasury estimates that 42 percent of households will pay no net income tax—that is, they will pay less in tax than they receive in welfare benefits, Working for Families, New Zealand superannuation, or accommodation subsidies. This compares with 39 percent in 2007-08, when this Government took office. That suggests tax and income support systems are more progressive today than they were in 2008.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>David Seymour</strong>: Has the Minister seen any reports of the National Party campaigning to make the tax and transfer system—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! No, that question is not in order. There is no ministerial responsibility at all for a political party.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Dr Shane Reti</strong>: What steps has the Government taken to help New Zealand families get ahead?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE</strong>: The economy remains front and centre of the Government's busy programme, which, of course, includes the Business Growth Agenda, which is helping to create more jobs and higher incomes for New Zealanders. We are seeing results. New Zealand currently has the second-highest employment rate in the developed world—that is the second-highest. Of every 100 people aged 16 and over, 66 are in work. That compares with 61 in Australia and Canada, 60 in the UK and the US, and 56 across the OECD as a whole. This is, in part, due to the 250,000 jobs that have been added to the economy over the last 3 years.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Dr Shane Reti</strong>: What steps has the Government taken to support lower-income families?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE</strong>: On 1 April this year the Government increased benefits for families with children by $25 a week. It is the first real increase since 1972. We also increased Working for Families payments to very low-income working families by $24.50 a week and to other working families by up to $12.50 a week, and we increased childcare assistance for low-income working families. On top of this, the Government has introduced free GP visits and prescriptions for under-13s, breakfasts in all schools that want it, social workers in all low-decile primary schools, the Youth Service for young teen beneficiaries, insulation in every State house that can be insulated, rheumatic fever prevention, Whānau Ora, and now the establishment of a new ministry to support vulnerable children.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: Which of the following achievements of his Government is helping to support New Zealand families the most: homelessness being the worst in living memory, according to the Salvation Army; 10 percent of New Zealanders owning 60 percent of the wealth, according to Statistics New Zealand, up from 55 percent; or his own admission that incomes are dropping despite GDP growth?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE</strong>: I would contest at least two of the member's statements there, if not all three. But in terms of the things this Government is most proud of, it is creating the climate, the job opportunities, and investment in job growth throughout New Zealand that is lifting employment—something like 325,000 jobs now since the global financial crisis—which is bringing Kiwis into work, which is raising their wages ahead of inflation, which means that more and more New Zealanders want to return home from other parts of the world, where they fled during the previous Government.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: In light of his answers to the primary and first supplementary questions, expressing confidence in the progressivity of the tax system, is he ruling out tax cuts being proposed by his Government before the next election?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE</strong>: No, I am not ruling anything out today, but I can tell the member that if the Government was in a position to improve the position of income taxes for New Zealanders, we would be looking to do it for all hard-working New Zealanders. </p></div></body>

There is the Housing New Zealand supply pipeline, where we see more Housing New Zealand homes in Auckland than we have had in the last 9 years—we have seen the number in Auckland increase. We are also seeing the announcement, like today, where we are seeing that community housing provider also increasing the supply that it has got.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Does she agree with the Salvation Army, which says that the Government has deliberately left thousands of State houses empty to justify selling them off?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: No, I do not—not at all. What we are seeing is a massive rebuild programme that is going on, not just in Auckland but throughout the country, where you can see examples of three Housing New Zealand houses being knocked down and then 13 being built on that same site. So we are seeing more houses being built. We are also doing a complete analysis of the pending sales throughout New Zealand, alongside the housing register that is going up in different places. So anywhere with over 100 applicants on the waiting list, or an increase of up to 40 to 50 percent, then we are looking at it to make sure that we have got the right synergies there as far as getting houses to the people who need them.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Dr Parmjeet Parmar</strong>: How will the $24.4 million in new funding for community housing providers that she announced today help to increase the supply of social housing in Auckland?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: Growing the role of community providers is a vital part of that comprehensive plan for social housing in particular. We have had the Social Housing Fund, which was very successful; the shoe fund; and today we announced another $24.4 million on top of the $120 million that was in this year's Budget. That means that we will be able to give a grant of up to 50 percent for new builds and, also, an additional 50 percent on top of the market rent for those who might be leasing. It will make a huge difference in getting some of those deals over the line. </p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Why is she wasting time quibbling with her own Government's official definition of homelessness, which was developed by the Ministry of Social Development, Housing New Zealand, and Statistics New Zealand and has now been adopted internationally—or are they all wrong and only she is right?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: To be frank, I do not spend a lot of time on that. Every day I am focused on getting more beds available for the New Zealanders who need them. That has been the key focus of this Government. We can see that supply coming through. We can see an increase in the number of emergency housing beds. In fact, right now we have got a deal out there in purchasing a motel for more emergency beds in Auckland as well as another whole lot of initiatives, including looking at community group houses. We are actually making sure that we are going to be looking at putting others into that as well.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Does she believe that 69-year-old Lynette Haines of Tauranga, who is renting a temporary cabin in a motor camp because she cannot find any affordable housing, should be regarded as homeless, or does she think that you are homeless only if people are stepping over you in the street?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: I do not know those circumstances for that particular woman and, as such, where it would be. It is irrelevant. What she actually needs is a permanent home where she can get that kind of access. That is what I am concentrating on and that is what we are making progress on, on this side. </p></div></body>

Changes to the high-risk section of State Highway 37 in Waitomo include side barriers to stop drivers running off the road, improved signage and road markings, and sections of the highway have been widened so that drivers who do lose control on corners have more time to recover. These improvements will make it a road more forgiving of human error, helping to reduce the amount of crashes in the first place and limiting the severity of the impact if they do occur. </p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Barbara Kuriger</strong>: What other projects can road users expect to see the Government deliver in Taranaki - King Country as part of the Government's $600 million Safer Roads and Roadsides programme?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon SIMON BRIDGES</strong>: All up, the Government is investing $23 million in six safety projects on rural State Highways 3, 23, and 37 in the Taranaki - King Country area in an effort to reduce serious injury and fatal accidents. The range of improvements to some of the country's most dangerous stretches of rural road will be a mix of roadside and median barriers, widening centre lines, road widening, improved signage, road markings, and rumble strips. All of these actions will reduce the risk of head-on and run-off-road crashes in Taranaki - King Country and are an important part of the Government's significant step up in road safety investment to reduce death and serious-injury crashes on New Zealand's rural roads. </p></div></body>

I was pleased to announce this morning that more than half of New Zealand schools are now working together in 148 communities of learning (COL). This means that to date, more than 1,260 schools and 18 early learning services have now formed communities of learning, supporting more than 410,000 kids. Twenty-six COLs have set their education achievement challenges, and 30 new community of learning leaders have now been appointed.

And when one is dealing with legal risk, one has to take into account a number of factors.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: Why has the Minister resisted, for over a year, disclosing whether any relevant legal advice did in fact exist?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON</strong>: Ultimately, I would have thought that the fact of legal advice and its contents were matters for the Attorney-General to determine.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I took that to be a claim that legal professional privilege questions are for the Attorney-General. That is not what is at issue here. It is not what the advice was; it is whether any advice existed. I think the Minister should be asked to answer that question.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: No, no. I think that on this occasion the Minister has answered it—clearly, not to the member's satisfaction. But the essence of the question, as to why the Minister resisted disclosure, the Minister certainly answered that.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: Did any such legal advice exist?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON</strong>: I have not actually seen any legal advice, because I am holding the fort, as it were. But the point is that there was an assessment by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade dealing with a range of matters, and, ultimately, it was a risk assessment that needed to be determined.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: Has anyone in MFAT, including the Minister, been provided with any part of the Auditor-General's draft report on her inquiry, over a year long, into the Saudi sheep deal?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON</strong>: The member in his question seems to be suggesting that the Auditor-General is taking an unduly lengthy period of time to determine this matter. The member should know, because he is an experienced member in this House, that the Auditor-General is an independent officer. She will conduct an inquiry, and then a draft report will be given to those who are affected, to enable them to comment so that natural justice questions are determined.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The essence of that question—and there were not two parts to it—was whether anyone in the ministry had been provided with a draft of the Auditor-General's report. I do not see why the Minister cannot address that.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The difficulty is that the question then included a comment from the questioner that the Auditor-General had commenced this inquiry "over a year ago"—I think were the words the member used. [<em>Interruption</em>] Order! The Minister took the opportunity to respond to that part of the question. If I can have more concise questions, I think it helps the House deliver the answer. On this occasion I will allow the member an additional question.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister has not answered the question I asked or even addressed it. The point as to the length of the report was not a question about whether it was a year long; it is an undisputed fact that it is. The question was—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! If the member would only refer to Standing Order 380, it states that supplementary questions need to be concise. The member himself put in a qualification about the length of time taken for the report. That gave the Minister the opportunity to then latch on to that part of the question. If it was not there, it would not have been able to be mentioned. To advance the cause, I have given the member an extra question. I would advise him to use it, otherwise we will move on.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I had not heard that when I took that point of order, I am sorry. Has anyone in MFAT, including the Minister, been provided with any part of the Auditor-General's draft report on her inquiry into the Saudi sheep deal?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON</strong>: I do not know. However, in order to try to be helpful to the member, I did outline the standard procedure that would be undertaken by the Auditor-General making an inquiry along these lines.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I would ask you to consider whether that is an acceptable answer, given that when Ministers are answering on behalf of other Ministers they are expected to be able to answer reasonable questions from the Opposition. I think that in the context of this controversy, that is the sort of question I would expect the Minister should have prepared for.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I will hear from the Hon Gerry Brownlee.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Gerry Brownlee</strong>: I think that when you do consider this, as I am sure you will, you will reflect on the comment made previously by the Minister answering the question that did outline the process, which makes it abundantly clear that the Minister answering the question today could not know that answer.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I think the important thing is that the Minister is acting on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was asked whether the draft report had been presented to MFAT and/or to the Minister. The Minister, acting on behalf, took the position that was clearly his honest view: he does not know. That is an answer given. I would certainly prefer that answer to one that then led to a discussion later about whether we had had somebody misleading the House.</p><h4 class="QSubjectheadingalone"><strong>Question No. 7 to Minister</strong></h4><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 14:45:14" ></a><strong>RICHARD PROSSER (NZ First)</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.

Can we just have this a bit more clearly—speak into the microphone. Perhaps if we have the Speaker's rulings the member wants to refer to.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>RICHARD PROSSER</strong>: They are Speaker's rulings 191/3 and 191/4, which you referenced in response to the Rt Hon Winston Peters' point of order regarding ministerial responsibility and the questioning between Ron Mark and the Minister of Police. Those points do relate to a Minister not necessarily having knowledge of what went on prior to their taking up that office, which is fair enough. But I believe that the Rt Hon Winston Peters' point of order was to do with responsibility itself, and Speaker's ruling 170/5 by Speaker Smith says "Just because a Minister may not have been present at the time does not relieve a Minister of being answerable for what took place.", referencing that a Minister was asked about a decision that occurred in his portfolio before he became a Minister. I am curious—even given the circumstances, the fact that the Minister may not have had knowledge does not relieve her of that responsibility.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 14:46:24" ></a><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I will have a look at the points the member has raised, and, if necessary, I will come back to him, if I decide to.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 14:46:33" ></a><strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE (</strong><strong>Leader of the House</strong><strong>)</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I have been reluctant to raise it because I always worry that someone is going to say that it is just me who cannot hear things, but it does appear that the sound system in here is rather quiet today. Certainly it was earlier, when members were asking questions over there, and when you spoke just a few seconds ago it was also very, very quiet.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 14:46:54" ></a><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I will certainly make sure that we have a look at the sound system immediately, and I thank the member.</p></div></body>

Statistics New Zealand reported that annual building activity in Auckland grew by 32 percent in the year to July and is now at the highest level ever. This is the fifth straight year of growth. Residential construction activity in Auckland has been growing at 25 percent compound since 2012, and activity is now more than three times that when National came to Government. The current $6.9 billion per year compares with $3.8 billion at the last peak, back in 2004. In inflation-adjusted terms the current level of activity is 43 percent higher—43 percent higher—than the highest level in the last 25 years.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Kanwaljit Singh Bakshi</strong>: How does the current boom in building activity compare with that in 2004?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The first difference I noted is that it is 40 percent higher in real-value terms. The second difference in today's building boom is much broader. It is not just residential activity; it includes record levels of commercial, industrial, and public infrastructure buildings like schools and hospitals. The third difference is that the number of dwellings built in 2004 was boosted by 5,000 apartments, many of which were as small as 30 square metres and in the next year were banned. [<em>Interruption</em>] The final difference, even if I use the numbers in 1974 or the numbers in 2004, is that it was only a boom for a year or two. We have had 5 straight years of growth of over 25 percent and are projected to achieve over 13,000 homes per year in the next 3 years.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Kanwaljit Singh Bakshi</strong>: What proportion of new building consents were in special housing areas in each of the last 3 years, and what impact would it have had on growth if they had not existed? </p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The number of building consents in special housing areas made up 6 percent of consents in 2013, 9 percent in 2014, and 14 percent in the last year. This growing pipeline reflects the time it takes from an area being zoned residential to getting the resource consents, getting the infrastructure built, and then getting the houses consented. The Auckland Council projects that over the next 10 years, 50 percent, or 45,000 homes, will be in those special housing areas.</p></div></body>

That is why the focus of the Government's freshwater reforms, including the national policy statement, the stock exclusion rules, the clean-up funds, and the implementing of good management practice are very much focused on that new challenge around diffuse pollution. </p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Eugenie Sage</strong>: Is it acceptable that the Hawke's Bay Regional Council allows intensive feedlots like this, with no need for a resource consent and no monitoring, given the amount of pollution that rain can flush into the Tukituki River and groundwater from land uses like this, in this style of farming?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: I would caution the member against connecting the difficulties in Havelock North directly with intensive farming, in that, actually, that area has a far lower level of intensive farming as compared with other areas—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Eugenie Sage</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. </p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: —and, secondly, I would note the data from GNS Science—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! I apologise.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Eugenie Sage</strong>: I was not attempting to link Havelock North, and the gastric outbreak there, with this activity. I was simply asking a straight question.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: But that is then a debatable matter. The Minister is choosing to answer it. I will allow the Minister to complete the answer.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: I note, in respect of the serious issues around the water supply in Havelock North, that the GNS Science analysis showed that the contaminated water was only 1 year old and was likely to be surface water, in that the aquifer water in that area is 50 years old. That would suggest it is an issue of the integrity of that well, rather than something for the Green Party to try to use as an issue, without evidence, to blame on farmers in the area.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Eugenie Sage</strong>: Will the Minister's proposed changes to the national policy statement for fresh water require regional councils to properly control intensive stock farming like those feedlots, or will he let intensive agriculture off the hook yet again? </p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: We are the first Government to have a national policy statement putting requirements on regional councils. When we came to Government, there was not a single catchment anywhere in New Zealand in which there were any restrictions on intensive farming—not one. There are now at least eight where intensive farming is not allowed, and there are a further 15 catchments as a consequence of our national policy statement where they are limiting nutrients from intensive agriculture.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Eugenie Sage</strong>: Does not his Government's failure to have strong and effective national policy under the RMA, which regulates land uses like this, allow those who benefit from these land uses to shift the costs on to the community through dirty water, dirty rivers, and dirty groundwater?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: I would ask where that member was when she was on Environment Canterbury and it did nothing? Where was the last Labour Government, which did nothing for 9 years? I would point to the fact that at least we have a national policy statement on freshwater management, and we have a further programme with the national regulations around stock exclusion and the tighter rules around nutrients, where we are actually setting national requirements to improve the quality of our fresh water. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Eugenie Sage</strong>: I seek leave to table rule 6.3.2 from the Hawke's Bay Regional Resource Management Plan, dated 1 October 2015, which allows the use of land as a permitted activity for feedlots and feed pads.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I will accept that it may be more difficult than normal for members to obtain that, and, therefore, I will put the leave and the House will decide. Leave is sought to table that particular document. Is there any objection? There is not.

I am going to invite the member to ask the primary question again.</p><p class="SubsQuestion"><strong>12. </strong><strong>STUART NASH (Labour—Napier)</strong> to the <strong>Minister of Police</strong>: How many additional staff hours will it take for Police to attend every reported burglary?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Before I call the Minister—the Rt Hon Winston Peters, I have asked for quiet and I would be grateful if you could also cooperate. </p><p class="SubsAnswer"><a name="time_20160906 14:56:47" ></a><strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS (Minister of Police)</strong>: The additional staff hours required will, of course, depend on the circumstances of each reported dwelling burglary, which, of course, is what the member should have referred to, rather than every reported burglary.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Stuart Nash</strong>: Is she really telling the House that she has instigated a major policy requiring the police to undertake significantly more work, and yet she has no idea of the implications for the hard-working police officer on the front line?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: Well, of course not. That member may have missed the excellent press release released by the Commissioner of Police on 27 June 2016, when he noted that it was his policy that dwelling burglaries would now be considered a priority offence and not a volume crime as was acceptable under the previous Labour Government. </p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Stuart Nash</strong>: What does she have to say to the police officer who said to the <em>New Zealand Herald</em> "we're expected to keep crime [rates] down, burglaries down [when] there's way more people, way more crime", considering that she has now required this officer to do more work without any more resources?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: Given that the police commissioner is the person who set in place the policy—and, by the way, I fully agree with that decision of his—I would say to that police officer that he or she should be very pleased that they have a Minister, a Government, and a commissioner that support them, as opposed to that member, who attacks the police quite personally at almost every opportunity he has.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Stuart Nash</strong>: In response to that, when 60 percent of police say they do not have enough training, almost 60 percent say they cannot deliver on the promises they make to the public, and almost 60 percent say they have too much stress in their job, how can she load them with so much more work without an increase in police numbers?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: Well, so many questions, and the answer is actually quite easy, really: the police are backed 100 percent by this Government. We have put on 600 extra police and there is also $400 million extra from the Budget than the police ever had under a previous Government.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Stuart Nash</strong>: When she announced this policy, was she actually aware that burglaries in our communities have increased by around 8,600, or 14 percent, over the last 12 months, to over 70,000 burglaries per year?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: I do not know how many times I have to tell that member, but the policy decision was actually announced by the Commissioner of Police on Monday, 27 June 2016, at 4.04 p.m. I am happy to provide that member with a link so he knows where the police website is. But, having said that, I can also tell him that, on average, in the 12 policing districts there are eight dwelling burglaries a day. Police already attend 70 percent of those, on average, and, actually, I think dwelling burglaries are very important. They are a home invasion, and people should expect a response.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Stuart Nash</strong>: So if the police attend 70 percent of burglaries at the moment, they are going to have to attend another 30 percent—where are they going to find the resources to undertake this?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: The commissioner has assured me that they can, and I am sure they will.</p><p class="QOAEnd"><a name="time_20160906 15:00:54 " ></a><strong> </strong></p></div></body>

The urgent debate is a way of holding the Government accountable for an action for which it is responsible and it must relate to a particular case of recent occurrence. The urgent debate procedure is not intended to address a continuing problem such as burglary statistics—[<em>Interruption</em>] Order!—which do not constitute a particular case of recent occurrence, and I refer members to Speakers' ruling 210/5 and Speaker's ruling 210/6. On this basis, the case raised does not meet the test for me to set aside the business of the House today. The application is, therefore, declined.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Debatealone"><strong>URGENCY</strong></p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 15:01:54" ></a><strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE (Leader of the House)</strong>: I move, <em>That urgency be accorded the introduction and passing through all stages of the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill</em>. This bill will allow the extension of special housing areas—</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Denis O</strong><strong>'</strong><strong>Rourke</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. [<em>Interruption</em>] </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! It is very unusual, but on this occasion a point of order has been called. I will hear it.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Denis O</strong><strong>'</strong><strong>Rourke</strong>: The reason I am calling a point of order is that this bill has been introduced as an omnibus bill under Standing Order 263(a) when it is not an omnibus bill.</p><p class="a">The reason I say that is that it meets neither of the two requirements in Standing Order 263(a), and the first point is this: the topics of the two amendments are not interrelated, and the term "interrelated", according to the dictionary, means "reciprocally or mutually related". That means each of the amendments must demonstrate either some reciprocity within a purpose or some mutuality of a purpose, and, in fact, these two measures do not do either of those things. One deals specifically with time limits for special housing areas, and the other deals specifically with offer-back provisions when State housing land is sold, so there is neither any reciprocity in purpose nor any mutuality of purpose.</p><p class="a">The second reason is that the other requirement is that it should implement a "single broad policy", according to the Standing Order, and, in fact, one purpose in this bill is the development of land for sale and the other affects social housing policy and, especially, the sale of it. So one policy relates to the development of land for sale, and the other to the sale of State housing land. Neither thing is related to each other at all in any policy context.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: Speaking to the point of order—</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I need no assistance, and I do thank members for offering their assistance. My office and I had a good look at this earlier today. The bill does two things in order to increase the supply and the affordability of housing. It makes amendments to the Special Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act 2013 and, secondly, it amends the Housing Act 1955 to clarify how the Public Works Act 1981 applies to the disposal of State housing land for use for housing purposes. Both relate to the stated purpose of increasing supply and affordability of land. It is in order and it does comply—[<em>Interruption</em>] Order! If I hear an interjection like that again, I will be asking for someone to leave. I am ruling that it does comply with Standing Order 263(a).</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Just before—I need to clarify that I have ruled quite categorically on whether this bill does comply. The member is absolutely free to raise any point of order on another matter unrelated to this. But if the member rises to his feet and continues now to argue, when I have given such a categoric ruling on this matter, that in itself will lead to disorder and I will consider very carefully whether I would be asking the member to leave.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: It is a new matter regarding whether or not a bill that is introduced under Standing Order 263(a) can be considered to be "implementing a single broad policy" when there is in this bill, in Part 2, in fact, an amendment that relates largely to the Public Works Act and does require no obligation for land freed up under that to be used for housing. So there is no obligation—so the outcome of this is not even related to housing in the end. There is no obligation for that land to be used for housing, so the only way, in my view, that this can be seen as an omnibus bill is to create such a wide definition of "a single broad policy" as to be meaningless.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: Speaking to the point of order—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I will hear from the Hon Dr Nick Smith.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: I think the two previous speakers failed to understand the interaction between—[<em>Interruption</em>]</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! If I hear that member interjecting on a point of order again, I will be asking him to leave the Chamber.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: Standing Order 263(a) requires that amendments deal with an interrelated topic. I would deal, for instance, very specifically with the very first special housing area in Weymouth, which is also exactly the land that is affected by the Housing Act provisions that are covered for in this bill. If we take one of the largest housing developments in Auckland, in Hobsonville—actually the largest housing development currently in Australasia—it is both a special housing area affected by this bill and it is also affected by the Housing Act. In fact, that interrelationship applies to over 30 of the special housing areas. So I think the reason for the points of order is that members have not understood the connection between special housing areas and the Housing Act 1955.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I have spent some time on this matter. I have given a ruling. It is not a ruling I gave lightly. Although I accept that members do not agree with what I have stated, we are moving forward. I have accepted that the bill does comply.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I think in that exchange there has been ample demonstration of the particularity that might be required to support the motion. What I will say, though, is that this bill extends provisions for affordable housing that have been very successful to date, and I look forward to members of the whole House who have concerns about affordable housing offering their support for it, but I of course recognise that, given the previous exchange, there are likely to be spurious reasons why people will not support it.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Chris Hipkins</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The House has set down a procedure for a Minister moving urgency to describe the nature of the urgency and why it is urgent. It does not allow for the Minister to then use that as an opportunity to pre-empt what Opposition members may say and to take a flick at other members of the House.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 15:09:04" ></a><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! No, there is certainly no need for the last part of the Minister's statement to be given. What this is is a chance for the Minister to explain the reason for urgency. He has done that. It is no longer a debatable motion, and I will put the question.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="BillDebate"><strong>HOUSING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL</strong></p><p class="SubDebate"><strong>First Reading</strong></p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 15:11:11" ></a><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH (Minister for Building and Housing)</strong>: I move, <em>That the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill be now read a first time.</em> This bill is about ensuring a smooth transition to the Auckland Unitary Plan, it is about extending the tool box of special housing areas to regional New Zealand, and it is about making the law clear in respect of Government housing programmes on publicly owned land. I do find it ironic that members of the Labour Opposition, who over the adjournment have been crying for a state of emergency over the issue of housing, are now saying no, they do not want to vote on a bill that will make a material difference.</p><p class="a">This bill builds on the very substantive work of the Productivity Commission. In 2012 its report concluded overwhelmingly that our land-use planning system was at the core of New Zealand's issues in respect of housing. I note that since 1990 the increase in house land costs in Auckland has gone up by 350 percent, compared with inflation of 71 percent and building costs of 78 percent. Those figures make very plain that it is the issue of land-use planning that is at the core of the challenges around housing affordability in Auckland.</p><p class="a">There was a huge dysfunctionality between the regional council and the district and city councils in Auckland, which were not able to agree on whether Auckland should go up or out, and so the very first and important step we made as a Government was to merge Auckland into a single council and require it to develop a single plan. The process of writing a plan for the city of Auckland would normally take a period of 7 or 8 years, noting that it would be the largest plan in New Zealand's history, covering over 500,000 properties. It is actually a tribute to Mayor Len Brown; his deputy, Penny Hulse; the independent hearings panel; and the Auckland Council that they have successfully concluded that process and that next Friday Auckland will have a new plan, one that succeeds rules that were written more than 20 years ago.</p><p class="a">We walked a fine line in the legislation between ensuring that process occurred as quickly as possible and also ensuring people had a fair say, and we determined that, in the interim, housing could not stand still. That is why we made provision for special housing areas. There are 154 of those that have been approved, and 1,342 houses were built and completed by the end of June. There are 2,208 building consents that have been approved, and resource consents for 6,700 sections have been approved. It is interesting to note that in the 12 months there would have been no growth in the number of residential consents and new homes built were it not for the 1,100 that came through the special housing areas process. That pipeline is growing, as evidenced by the fact that in the first year it was 6 percent, in the second year it was 9 percent, and it is now 14 percent. Next year it is scheduled to be over 20 percent and for the year following 30 percent.</p><p class="a">That brings me to the key provisions that are provided for in this bill. The first issue is around transitioning from those special housing areas over to the new Auckland Unitary Plan. Of those 154 special housing areas, there are eight for which there is doubt as to whether the plan-change process will be concluded by next Thursday. Without this bill—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: When did you find out? Why has it taken you this long?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: —those 8,000 homes would not be able to progress. Mr Robertson interjects—when did we know that? Well, actually, we still do not absolutely know, because there are independent hearings panels that are independent and are currently considering housing in those areas. Equally so, we did not know until the unitary plan process was complete, because we did not know what areas had been zoned as residential.</p><p class="a">What this bill does is ensure that those 8,000 homes can proceed. I note that these provisions have the very strong support of the Auckland Council. I would say to members of this House: if you are genuinely concerned about housing issues in Auckland, why would we send those eight significant developments—for 8,000 homes—back to the beginning of the process?</p><p class="a">When we brought the special housing areas process to Parliament it was very controversial—there was concern in local government. What is interesting is that I have had a number of letters from councils around the country, like Queenstown—and my meetings last week in the Bay of Plenty, and meetings in Christchurch—and also in areas such as Auckland and my own constituency, where local governments recognise the pressures around housing that they now have in their areas. Although they are supportive of the Government's additional programmes of work—the Resource Management Act reforms, the National Policy Statement on Urban Development, the urban development authority—they want to make progress now and they want the tools of the special housing area Act extended.</p><p class="a">That is the second part of this bill, which will enable those accords to be extended in order for local government and central government to work together on providing additional housing supply and have access to those fast-track methods for bringing in new housing supply. In amending that special housing areas legislation, the only change in the provision is to put extra pressure on the landowner and require that plan changes and resource consents are lodged within 12 months. There is a further, minor amendment to simply make the process less bureaucratic and allow those identified special housing areas to be divided by a plan and plan description, rather than just a description of the title specifically.</p><p class="a">The third and final issue that is covered in this bill is the issue of the Housing Act and the way in which it is able to bring new houses on stream. That is important. The biggest housing development in New Zealand is in Hobsonville, which is former defence land. If we look at the Weymouth development, which I think every member of this House would say is a great initiative—it was the first special housing area—it also is surplus Crown land. The difficulty is that Governments for generations have assumed that when there is a housing development under the Housing Act it will not trigger the offer-back provisions. How do we know that? Because Governments and Ministers—on Labour's side of the House; on this side of the House—whenever they have sold properties coming from such developments, have not triggered those offer-back provisions. The clear advice is that it was never intended that the offer-back provisions would apply where there is a housing development under the Housing Act. This bill provides clarity in that area of law, and it is important to Weymouth and it is important to Hobsonville because it provides the certainty that we are able to partner with the private sector and ensure that we continue to grow that important pipeline of new housing.</p><p class="a">Every member of this House knows that there is pressure on housing. The truth is that New Zealand's population is growing faster than at any time in our history. That is because people are voting with their feet—there is confidence in New Zealand and confidence in this Government—but, equally, that puts an onus on us to ensure that we build as many houses as we can and remove any legislative or bureaucratic impediment to more houses being built. That is why I challenge every member of this House to support new houses, more houses, for New Zealanders. This bill, this urgency, is a test as to whether members want to play politics or whether they want to support more houses being built for Kiwi families.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 15:21:22" ></a><strong>ANDREW LITTLE (Leader of the Opposition)</strong>: You can tell just how serious this Minister is in getting this piece of legislation through, because he is relying on the crack team of Craig Foss to have to usher him along to get the bill through—this is how vital and essential this piece of legislation is. The reality is that the Minister cannot bring himself, even now—10 days out from the expiry of the special housing area legislation and having to rush through this piece of legislation—to admit what every New Zealander knows, and that is that we have a housing crisis. We have a housing crisis. He is just cobbling something together at the last minute, because he has suddenly realised that the dream of special housing areas is about to fly out the window with so few special houses built—he has got to do something about it.</p><p class="a">I do not know how he persuaded his Cabinet colleagues to take the time of the House to pass this through under urgency when he has known, when he will have known, when he did know, that the legislation that we are now amending was coming up for expiry only 10 days away—only 10 days away. This urgency in this House for this piece of legislation is an expression of the complete and utter shambles that housing policy is in under this Minister for Building and Housing and this Government. That is what this is about. This House is taking its valuable time at this important time of the year to sweep up after this Minister yet again because of the total shambles that his policy is in. Every effort he has made, every policy he has introduced on housing, has completely turned to custard.</p><p class="a">You look at the special housing areas and you look at the number now that are being offered for sale on TradeMe for land banking—they get the special housing areas, and yet some developers have no intention whatsoever of fulfilling the criteria and actually getting houses built. The whole condition of getting expedited consenting processes was that these developers with this special status would actually get houses built. But that is not happening in far too many cases. It is true that the Minister says there are a handful of them, they have got their applications lodged, and they have just got to bring it on a bit—this is with 10 days to go before the expiry of this legislation. There are far too few houses being built on special housing areas, and that is the problem—they have gone to land bankers.</p><p class="a">The reality is that we have a chronic shortage of housing in Auckland and in other parts of New Zealand, and this Minister and his Government have failed to deliver for the thousands of New Zealanders struggling to get their first home. Let us not be mollycoddled by the figures that both the Minister and the Prime Minister have been trotting out. Let us be very clear that the 9,651 houses consented in the last 12 months are below the 12,000—nearly 13,000—consented in 2004. That was at a time when Auckland's population was much, much smaller. So on a per capita basis, the building programme right now is way behind—absolutely way behind. If you have a look at what Statistics New Zealand says, and its analysis of the number per thousand people—sure, it has risen to 6.3 in the last 12 months from the low of 3.1 in 2011, but that is still only half what it was in 1974. That is the real measure—number of houses per thousand people—and this Government is way behind.</p><p class="a">It is a comparative issue, and it is about New Zealanders' prospects about getting into a house. It is no longer just any house, because plenty of builders are building the big, expensive, McMansion, million-dollar-average houses—plenty of those. It is that those on modest incomes are working hard, sometimes at more than one job—couples with several jobs between them—saving hard, working hard, chasing that Kiwi Dream, but they cannot get it. They cannot get it, because this Government does not care about affordable housing. This Government does not care about affordable housing. This legislation will help five—five—out of 154 special housing areas. We know that of the other 149 there are plenty that are just being land banked. That is all they are. There is no serious programme—there is no serious programme—to accelerate affordable house building under this Government in New Zealand today.</p><p class="a">We could support this first part of this legislation, because at this stage anything—the smallest thing, the smallest skerrick of anything—that will help get one extra affordable house, I have to say that we have to support it. We would have to support that. But that does not explain or justify why the Minister has included these other provisions on the offer-back provisions under the Public Works Act. That is completely unrelated to anything to do with special housing areas and getting more affordable housing built. It is not needed. The provisions are not needed to achieve the objectives that he has of using special housing areas to get houses built. It simply is not needed. That assumes, of course, that even if these other special housing area applications are approved by the council after this legislation passes it will lead to more affordable housing very quickly—even assuming that, the Public Works Act provisions are not needed.</p><p class="a">The reality is—and I want to hear from David Seymour from the ACT Party about this, because I think that the good burghers of Epsom will be very interested to know what is potentially happening to their property rights. Those who lounge back in the leafy streets of Epsom and Parnell, wondering how their investment properties are going, they will be wanting to know whether or not any property they own, or that they have an interest in or have had an interest in, that has been purchased under the Public Works Act—whether they are going have the right to get it back, because under these amendments they will not. Their rights will be traduced. Private property rights will be traduced in these provisions. It is not standard practice for the Labour Party to champion the cause of private property owners, but in the absence of the Government, and, so far, in the absence of the ACT Party, we have to. We have to, because nobody else is, and we ought to take that sort of measure very seriously. This House should not be passing legislation that traduces those rights quickly or inadvisedly or expeditiously just because we have a Minister who has performed so woefully in his portfolio that we are down to desperate measures.</p><p class="a">The reality is this: New Zealand needs a genuine, comprehensive housing plan to fix the housing crisis. We need a housing policy and a housing package that is going to get more houses built, including, if necessary, in Clutha-Southland but certainly in the many other areas around New Zealand: Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Taupō—as I discovered the other day—even up the Kāpiti Coast, parts of Wellington, Nelson, and Queenstown. New Zealanders are looking for an answer. They are looking for leadership on the issue of housing—genuinely affordable housing—because those on modest incomes, those on reasonable incomes, who work hard and save hard and do the best they can, no matter how hard they try, cannot get their foot on that bottom rung of the housing and homeownership ladder. That too we should be concerned about.</p><p class="a">This piece of legislation, the first part, adds a mere skerrick, a mere iota, of difference to that objective, but that is all. But the other part, the second part, the offer-back provisions, will not help one bit. We are opposed to those, and so we cannot support this legislation in its current form.</p><p class="a">There remains a possibility, I hope, that during the passage of this bill through the House under urgency the Minister might come to his senses, his colleagues might come to their senses, David Seymour might come to his senses, and say: "You know what? We all agree there is a housing crisis. We know something has to be done. We do need those special housing area provisions, as small a contribution as they will make to the housing crisis, but we do not need to traduce private property rights and create a constitutional crisis that we just don't need." If that happens, we could support the legislation but not in its current form—cobbled together, in a hurry, because this Minister is so desperate to prove, once again, that he does not have to get absolutely everything wrong. Well, he is on a hiding to nothing on that already, so let us just be honest about it. Let us just be honest about it.</p><p class="a">This legislation, if it confines itself to the special housing area issues alone, we can support. In its current form, we cannot because it takes unnecessary steps that will add nothing at all to additional housing affordability, and while that is there, this legislation cannot be supported and will not be supported. I simply urge the Minister to look carefully and listen carefully. If we want to do the right thing for New Zealand and the housing crisis, it will not be in this bill in its current form.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 15:31:53" ></a><strong>ALFRED NGARO (National)</strong>: I rise to take a call in this first reading of the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill, which is going through all stages. First, I want to acknowledge that this National-led Government has a comprehensive plan for housing.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Members</strong>: Ha, ha!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>ALFRED NGARO</strong>: That is right. We hear the heckling. But here is the proof of the pudding. Over there, on that side, the spokesperson on housing has often confirmed the comprehensive plan. When we think about the devolution of stock into the community housing providers—it was at the conference where the Labour spokesperson on housing turned around and said "We support this. This is a good idea. We should do this.", and then, all of a sudden, when we were doing it, he disagreed with it. When it came to the metropolitan urban limits, the Labour spokesperson on housing turned around and said "No, this is not a great idea. We shouldn't attack this.", and then, all of a sudden, when we were addressing the metropolitan urban limits, he changed again. Why? Because he saw that this was a comprehensive plan. We know it is comprehensive. We know it is making a difference. </p><p class="a">This Housing Legislation Amendment Bill does two things in particular. It extends two Acts, which we think is important, and it also puts a time limit on the consenting process. We think that is important. </p><p class="a">The previous speaker talked about the whole issue around the crisis. But if the speakers on the other side have actually done their homework, and I hope that they have, they will realise that this issue has been bubbling up since 1974. In fact, a previous Cabinet Minister in the Labour Government, the Hon Dr Michael Bassett, was commissioned by The New Zealand Initiative to write a report. The report was called <em>Priced Out</em>. In that report he talked about when housing became unaffordable in New Zealand. Inside that report, he clearly states that this is an issue that has been happening since 1974. Why? Because we have not been building to projected forecast growth in New Zealand over that period of time. We know that that has been happening for quite some time, so we think that is really important. </p><p class="a">Also, although the little mumbling and ground-grinding over there—[<em>Interruption</em>] Yes, maybe he needs to listen. If he has read the Productivity Commission's report, what does it also say? It says that one of the critical issues is around the slow process of consenting. The special housing accord allows for us to fast track the consenting so that we can ensure that we can address the issue. What does it say? It says that the issue is around supply. This housing issue is around supply. We think that this is critically important. </p><p class="a">The National-led Government wants to extend the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act so that more special housing areas can be established and are appropriate for those different areas as well. We know that currently in Auckland, which is one of the most difficult places, there are 213 special housing areas—at least 140 of those are in the Auckland area—and that is making a difference. This will allow for the capacity of nearly 70,000 homes—almost 65,000 of those are in the Auckland area. This becomes critical. </p><p class="a">When people have talked about the metropolitan urban limits, and if we talk about Auckland in particular, where this becomes a critical issue and the housing accord and this bill become of greatest importance, the metropolitan urban limits came in 1999 under the Auckland Regional Council. It was an arbitrary line that was drawn. We know that from that period of time we could see the challenges that were happening. In 2008 Gordon Copeland, who was a member of the Commerce Committee, went up to Auckland. That committee conducted an inquiry. It clearly said that the metropolitan urban limits were allowing for land banking, hence the reason why this bill becomes critically important in addressing that issue as well. </p><p class="a">This legislation will allow for a variation of applications, begun but not completed under the law, to continue when a district plan becomes operative. We know that the current unitary plan will come into place on 16 September this year, so that is the reason why it is important for us to extend that and to allow for the opportunities for that development to happen. We know, also, that when we think about what currently exists, we think about the incentivised process of this plan and why that becomes important. </p><p class="a">We can look at some of the numbers—the construction growth. The number of homes being constructed per year, in areas with housing accords, has grown from 10,599 in the year to June 2013 to 18,693 to June of this year. We know that it makes a difference. We see that is important. I commend this bill and look forward to the ongoing debate in the House under urgency. I commend this bill, at its first reading, to the House.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 15:37:23" ></a><strong>PHIL TWYFORD (Labour—Te Atatū)</strong>: This is obviously not a bill that Government members are very proud of—when we see the stellar collection of front-bench heavy hitters who have turned out to support Dr Smith on this bill! The second member to speak from the National Party benches, Alfred Ngaro, could not even sum up a 5-minute contribution. All the heads are down. They are embarrassed because this bill is just the latest in a string of fiascos that pass for housing policy under this Minister. The image that I want you to entertain is of the Hon Dr Nick Smith standing out in the middle of a paddock somewhere in west Auckland, bewildered, and pointing in all directions, saying: "We're going to build houses here, folks." That Minister is outstanding in his field. He is outstanding in his field. </p><p class="a">One of the great contributions that he has made to housing policy in the last couple of years has been a minibus tour where he took hapless members of the press gallery on a never-ending magical mystery tour of cemeteries, electrical substations, and a long list of other scraps and remnants. The Governor-General's residence, Government House, even appeared on a list of Government properties that that Minister used as the basis for his now famous promise to this Parliament that he had 500 hectares of vacant Crown land that he was going to use to build housing. So that is great—look, you have got to give it to this Minister. He has provided more entertainment to this House in the last couple of years, in the form of his housing policies, than anyone could have realistically hoped for. </p><p class="a">This bill is yet another patch-up job designed to mask the failings of Nick Smith as the Minister for Building and Housing. His incompetence is not a reason to put this House into urgency and to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money to ram through a bill that simply should not be considered under urgency by this House. The bill has two main parts. The first is to extend the special housing areas legislation by 3 years. At a pinch, we might have voted for that—at a pinch. The special housing areas are a flawed, inadequate, underwhelming policy—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: You voted against it.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>PHIL TWYFORD</strong>: We voted for it at the first reading, but when we actually had a serious look at it, we realised how hopeless it was. It is the centrepiece of the Government's supply-side initiatives. How many houses has it delivered in 3 years, in a city of a million and a half people? There are barely 1,300 completed houses. Under this National Government, a shortfall of 42,000 houses has accumulated while National has been in office. That shortage is getting worse by about 4,000 dwellings every single year, and the best that this National Government's policy of special housing areas can deliver is 1,300 houses over 3 years. </p><p class="a">This bill is the last whimper of Nick Smith's special housing areas policy. But it is something at least. It is better than nothing—which is why we would vote for it—but not by very much. The best thing that can be said for it is that it will save eight developers. Eight special housing areas in Auckland will be saved from cost uncertainty and the inconvenience caused by Nick Smith's failure to properly think through the transition issues as the special housing areas legislation died and the Auckland Unitary Plan came on stream. </p><p class="a">On its own, we would, at a pinch, have voted for Part 1 of this bill, which extends the housing accords and special housing areas legislation. But, as Andrew Little said, the second part—which deals with offer-back provisions under the Public Works Act in relation to Government land being used for housing purposes—is a whole different kettle of fish. Not only do we believe that there is no justification at all for this provision being considered under urgency but it is actually a really bad idea. I think it might be quite interesting to put some bets on the table that this bill and these provisions in Part 2 will be the next Nick Smith fiasco in a long line—a long, honourable line—of fiascos.</p><p class="a">Nick Smith said that he is just trying to clarify—and no doubt he has got advice from Crown Law, and I would ask the Minister to table the advice from Crown Law on this—the position that the Government is not required to observe the offer-back provisions in the Public Works Act to former owners of land when it is changing the designation of Government-owned land and making it available for State housing purposes, which is interpreted extremely widely by this Government. He is saying the position is that the Government is not required to offer back that land if it is being used for housing purposes. Well, my question is this: if the law really does say that he is not required to hand it back, then why is he ramming through a bill under urgency—all stages? Why is he doing that if the law is clear and is not an issue? Because the Minister has brought this bill to the House, and because he is ramming it through under urgency, it is very clear, actually, that he is taking away somebody's property rights. </p><p class="a">We are not lily-livered on this side of the House about powers of acquisition and the need to prevent land bankers from gaming the system and standing in the way of large new developments that will deliver thousands of new dwellings in the public interest. But if you are going to take away people's property rights, then, for goodness' sake, think about it seriously. Do it in a way that is transparent and open, and subject this bill to the proper scrutiny, expert advice, and public submissions that a select committee process would bring. Do not ram it through the House under urgency. It is a serious matter when you are taking away someone's property rights, so treat it seriously, treat the citizens of this nation with the respect they deserve, and do it in a way that is thoughtful, careful, and considered. There is no possible reason to take these provisions through the House under urgency in 24 hours and to deny the people of New Zealand the right to have this bill given proper scrutiny. This is the "Minister of Housing Fiascos". This is the next fiasco that is coming down the pipeline, and, no doubt, in a year's time we will be back in the House to clean up this mess. </p><p class="a">The great fiasco of Nick Smith and vacant Crown lands was not so much that he produced a list that had Government House, electricity substations, and the Mangere Lawn Cemetery on it. The real fiasco was that he completely failed to consult important stakeholders like Auckland iwi on his plans to deny them their right of first refusal under the collective redress agreements in Tāmaki-makau-rau. He thought he could get away with it. I do not know what advice he took on that, but he blundered on ahead with his plan and was humiliated by Ngāti Whātua and other members of the Tāmaki Collective, who took him to court and forced him to do a—it was not so much a flip-flop; it was more a double backflip. He had to negotiate a humiliating climb-down that gave them rights to be development partners and all sorts of commitments about the provision of affordable housing in those developments, which he would not even offer to Auckland Council when he was negotiating the housing accord. </p><p class="a">In this bill, he has had to recognise that that was an ignominious defeat. Not only did it cost tens of thousands, even $100,000 or more, in legal costs to the Crown but his Crown lands policy was delayed by months and months and months. What he has had to do in this bill is say that nothing in Part 2 of this bill will have any impact on collective redress agreements, but he is intending to deny previous owners of land their rights under the Public Works Act to an offer-back provision. This bill should go to the select committee.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 15:47:37" ></a><strong>TODD BARCLAY (National—Clutha-Southland)</strong>: It is a privilege to be able to speak in support of the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill—and it is also a privilege to speak after Phil Twyford, given his positions on housing in New Zealand creating a fiasco of their own. This is the guy who called for a national emergency on housing, but will not support urgency on important housing legislation. I have been a strong advocate for an extension of the special housing areas because my electorate has benefited considerably from seven special housing areas to date, and because of this legislation, which I hope will pass, we will benefit from another, hopefully, up to half a dozen special housing areas—an additional couple of thousand houses coming on board in Queenstown, which is considerably important. Phil Twyford was opposed to the HomeStart initiative, but has expressed supportive comments in the past. He also wanted a capital gains tax—now he is opposed to that. Phil Twyford was also in favour of selling State houses, but is now opposed to it. He has got more positions on housing than anybody else.</p><p class="a">This is an important piece of legislation. It is a great bill, and if he were to talk to any developer, any community housing provider, any home loan business, or any business in any of the fastest-growing areas within this country, he would know that they are also in support of this legislation. If he had been down to Queenstown—which he has—instead of just going up on to the ski field and having a great time, if he had actually talked to the Community Housing Trust there he would have found out that we have benefited by over a thousand new houses in the Queenstown area, delivered only under special housing legislation. We have had seven special housing areas under this, and we hope to see some more.</p><p class="a">Andrew Little's Public Works Act provisions are not needed; that is another example of how out of touch those guys are around housing in New Zealand. We have got a perfect case in point in my electorate at the moment, where the Housing Act is preventing, possibly, the onsale of Government-owned land to be used for worker accommodation and affordable housing simply because a former owner—20, 30, or 40 years ago—can put up his hand and say "I might quite like that piece of land." Actually, that land is necessary to use for special housing and worker accommodation. This provision that we are passing today enables that demand to be met very quickly, so it is a privilege to be able to support this legislation. I want to congratulate the Minister on all his hard work in this space and thank him on behalf of my electorate for facilitating more houses being built. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 15:50:16" ></a><strong>METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green)</strong>: One million dollars—the average house price in Auckland today reached $1 million; $1 million to buy a house in Auckland. This Government has driven New Zealand's housing into the ground. It has stripped away from ordinary New Zealanders the ability to secure their future for themselves and their children by driving up housing so it is so expensive that in order to buy a home in Auckland the average price is now $1 million.</p><p class="a">And what do Government members say about that? Are they concerned about that increase in the cost of housing in Auckland? Are they worried that young families are being locked out? Are they worried that teachers, firemen, people who work in the Fire Service—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: The police.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>METIRIA TUREI</strong>: —and the police, these people who are essential to our communities across the country, in Auckland cannot afford to buy a house in the city that they love and serve? Are National members worried about that? </p><p class="a">Well, no, and that is obvious today because, in response to the $1 million average house price announcement, we end up spending a whole day debating this ridiculous bill that will not solve the housing crisis. If they were genuinely serious about making sure that people who work in the Fire Service, or teachers, or principals of schools, or nurses or doctors—these people who serve our communities in Auckland—were actually able to live a decent life in a secure home in Auckland we would not be passing this bill, we would be dealing with a genuine comprehensive plan to make sure there was affordable housing in our biggest city so that ordinary New Zealanders had a genuine chance to own their home.</p><p class="a">Instead, we are dealing with a piece of rushed legislation that is poorly thought out, that strips away the property rights of some, in order only to extend what has been a failed policy in Auckland. The special housing areas (SHAs) policy has failed in Auckland and this legislation is designed to extend that failed policy because this Government has no other ideas about how to fix New Zealand's housing crisis—a crisis that has seen homelessness increase beyond all measure over the last few decades—and it is seeing young families and elderly people locked out of securing their future.</p><p class="a">The special housing areas have not delivered in Auckland. Of the 157, 97 have no building on them; two-thirds have no building on them. They are simply sitting there, and do you know why? It is because land bankers and speculators are making a huge amount of money by sitting on these special housing areas that Nick Smith and the Government have allowed them to have cheap. As I understand it, only 1,300 buildings have been built. That is a ridiculous failure by this Government over the last 3 years. Special housing areas have helped many speculators and many land bankers increase their wealth while hard-working families, young people trying to secure their future, and older people trying to secure their retirement are locked out of housing in Auckland.</p><p class="a">It is a continuation of Government's housing failure that this is how we have to spend our time: dealing with this bill. It will not solve the crisis and, indeed, it could make it worse by extending special housing areas and not dealing with the land banking issue that they create. This bill is nothing but a band-aid on a wound, a housing wound that ordinary New Zealand families are having to carry every day. I think that "fiasco" is the right word for this Government's response in this legislation. We are in the middle of a homelessness crisis, the nature of which we have not seen for decades—for decades; a $1 million average house price in Auckland, State housing still being sold off while the waiting list for State houses grows and grows, and the only response is this rushed piece of legislation, poorly considered and desperate to keep the special housing areas going.</p><p class="a">Why is that? It is because the Government's only solution is to allow more private developers to have access to land and have access to fast-tracking consents. That is its only solution. It is taking no responsibility for its role in being able to provide housing itself through a comprehensive build programme that New Zealanders are desperately crying out for. The Government knows that it can be much more engaged in actually building affordable homes. Instead, its solution is to allow land developers, speculators, and land bankers to make more money off this crisis. </p><p class="a">What does the bill actually do? Well, what the first part does allow is really in response to just eight developers in eight special housing areas that are halfway through their consenting process—so they are nearly complete but they have not completed their consenting process. If the special housing areas legislation expires on 16 September, as it is set to do, then those eight developers will have to restart their consenting process over again. There is an argument that says it would be worthwhile extending the time period to allow those eight developers to get their consents through—as long as, of course, they were actually required to build, and it was not just another attempt, another opportunity, for Nick Smith and National to allow more land banking.</p><p class="a">If that was the case, that there was certainty that they would build, there is an argument that says we could use urgency to allow for that extension of time. Perhaps we could have a day of select committee. We could hear from officials and from those affected so as to be able to know that we have all of the information right and that when we were passing a law through urgency that that law would be properly considered, properly constructed, and effective. This is because a large part of the problem with urgency, of course, is that most of the law we pass through urgency is useless and full of mistakes. So that is an argument for saying that part of the bill could be justified with a short period for consultation with the public and those affected. I would have listened to that argument and taken it seriously if it had been put to me.</p><p class="a">The problem is that the bill also does other things that do not need to go through urgency and that actually do need to be properly considered. These are the two areas. The legislation extends the failed SHAs for another 3 years and it does not protect against land banking. The provisions in this little bill do not protect against land bankers. It gives the Minister for Building and Housing more powers and sets a time frame, but there was already a time frame in the previous legislation. It does not prevent land banking and that is one of the major problems, the major failures, of the SHAs in Auckland. Neither does this bill improve the percentage required to be for affordable housing. So the problem for SHAs is that we cannot guarantee that there will be a significant provision of affordable housing through these special housing areas. This bill does not require more affordable housing from those special housing areas. It, again, provides wealth acquisition opportunities for the speculators, but will not deliver affordable housing for the thousands of New Zealanders who need it. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: That's rubbish! Just rubbish!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>METIRIA TUREI</strong>: The Minister keeps saying it is rubbish, but there is nothing in his bill that is going to improve the provision of affordable houses in those SHAs. It gives him more powers; it does not provide any more certainty to New Zealanders who are desperate for this housing because they are in such dire straits.</p><p class="a">And of course we have the offer-back provisions, which provide real concern. Nick Smith says that there are no Māori who provided that land for use for housing and who would be the first people under an offer-back provision to be offered that land back. He does not know that for sure. He does not know that for sure, but he says he does not think there is any—and we are supposed to accept that from Nick Smith, who thinks that birds pooing in rivers is more important and more dangerous than cows pooing in rivers. This is not a man with a great sense of perspective about what is important.</p><p class="a">We cannot support this bill in its current form. We do expect there to be some changes over the course of today and tonight—perhaps a splitting of the bill. But as it stands it is ineffective, it is a waste of time, and it will simply increase the risk of land banking and a lack of affordable housing in Auckland. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 16:00:11" ></a><strong>DENIS O</strong><strong>'</strong><strong>ROURKE (NZ First)</strong>: How dare that Minister over there, the Minister for Building and Housing, claim the success of special housing areas when after 3 years we see 1,300 houses having been built. Now we have a panic measure to expand that by another 3 years. That will not help the situation, because success will not result from a failure; it will just be more failure. This Government should not be allowed one more day in power when it has made such an unholy mess of housing in New Zealand through its own actions. It is this Government's actions that have actually caused the housing crisis, and it is this Government's inaction that has failed to remedy it. In addition to all of that, you have a situation where as a result of an open-ended immigration policy—which actually does create significant demand, despite denials by the Government—it then has to panic to provide more homes when that could be avoided by having a sensible immigration policy and a genuine strategy for building homes in New Zealand.</p><p class="a">The housing policy that is actually claimed to be a comprehensive housing policy is none of that. It is nothing at all like that. It is getting worse. The effects of it are getting worse through Government inaction, and the need for this particular bill is just evidence of that.</p><p class="a">Look at the results in Auckland, where people are actually leaving in droves because they cannot buy houses there because of the prices. They cannot rent there because the rents are too high, and between 2008 and 2013, 32,184 of them left Auckland for Wellington, Waikato, Canterbury, and elsewhere, while 3,000 less than that number went there from those areas. So there is actually a drift away from Auckland because of these problems. The problem with that is, as Shamubeel Eaqub said: "The challenge for a lot of people is they're not able to get the same kinds of jobs or job security in other parts of New Zealand." That is probably why it is only a third of the people saying that they have actually considered it.</p><p class="a">It is actually worse than that. It is worse than that because, in fact, while 32 percent of Aucklanders want to move out because of housing pressures, another 36 percent would also go if they could get adequate employment in the other regions. That outflow is actually hurting Auckland's economy. As Alan Johnson of the Salvation Army said: "There's people leaving Auckland in bigger numbers than ever because of the house prices. It will undermine the city's competitiveness. People doing lower-paid jobs, particularly in the service and construction sectors, need to be able to afford to live in the city." Is that not putting it in a nutshell? So the fundamental problem, as we all know, is that housing in Auckland is actually unaffordable, and, worse than that, it is still a runaway problem. </p><p class="a">The failure to deal with that is all based on this Government's neo-liberal belief in the market as being a way of solving these problems. It seems to think that blaming local government and providing more liberal planning laws will somehow result in a solution to these problems. Of course, it is, as I have said, exacerbated by an open-door immigration policy. And it is caused by Ministers—three of them, in fact—who are simply not on top of their jobs. They simply do not know how to do this; they do not know how to solve it, and they should all resign. In fact, the whole Government should go and let parties into Government that can actually deal with these issues.</p><p class="a">In the context of such comprehensive policy failure—and that is what it is—New Zealand First will not support this bill. In that context, New Zealand First will not support this bill. There are two reasons. The Government is hanging its hat on one primary action: these special housing areas. New Zealand First does not have a problem with special housing areas in themselves. We do not disagree with that. That is OK. It is actually consistent with New Zealand First policy. But, in fact, it is not enough, because all it does, as I have already indicated, with local government agreement through housing accords, is to define land available for housing. It does no more than that—and because it does no more than that it does not necessarily result in more houses being built and, especially, it does not result in more houses that people can afford to buy being built. Therefore, it is a failed policy and for that reason—because it does not go far enough, it does not do enough—how could New Zealand First possibly agree to such measures to extend it?</p><p class="a">After 3 years of failure, and because of the Government's failure to actually invest in housing rather than just provide for these areas, we have a continuation, and we will continue to see a worsening housing crisis in Auckland. Without actual investment in the purchase of land and the development of land by the Government, this problem will never cease, because the market cannot—cannot—provide what is needed in New Zealand. And that is no surprise—that has actually been the case for a very long time in this country, and it has not changed. Why this Government thinks it will, I cannot possibly imagine.</p><p class="a">The pathetic 1,300 house result will, actually, continue. Maybe it will do a little bit better than 1,300 over the next 3 years, but that is such a drop in the bucket it does not even begin to address the housing crisis, especially in Auckland. New Zealand First's housing policy is much better than this—and I can see the Minister grinning.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: I'm laughing.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>DENIS O</strong><strong>'</strong><strong>ROURKE</strong>: Look at him laughing. He should be laughing at himself, because we can see his policy in total failure, and yet he will not listen to anybody else. The fact is that New Zealand First wants a housing commission to do the strategic planning that this Government does not even consider to be necessary.</p><p class="a">Secondly, New Zealand First would establish Kiwi Housing to buy and develop land on a scale that this Government has not even considered, to ensure modest homes are built for modest prices, and to allow easy term repayments for people who wish to buy them.</p><p class="a">The second and unrelated part of the bill is to change the law—not to confirm it or clarify it, as is being claimed—to change the law to allow the sale of State housing land without offer-back provisions. That is the normal process. Those offer-back provisions are the normal process under the Public Works Act because they protect the rights of people. Those rights should always be respected and should not be done away with simply because this Government is in panic mode over housing in New Zealand. That is not good enough. People's rights are worth more than that. We will not support that provision for that reason alone.</p><p class="a">In addition to that, the fact that the Government is looking at this actually demonstrates its failure of strategic planning and implementation. If it had looked forward enough, done the planning, and had a decent strategy, it would actually have the time to buy and develop land without having to do these short cuts and without having to compromise people's rights.</p><p class="a">I want to point out some of the words that the Government claims justify this. On the end of the justification are the words "where the disposal is necessary to achieve the Crown's housing objectives." Well, what are those objectives? The Government claims they are to build more houses—but this is State housing land. It is social housing land we are talking about, and the objective of the Government is actually the sell-off of State houses in the absence of a genuine and comprehensive programme for the building of more State houses. It is also their objective to fob off State housing to community organisations, many of which are actually not capable of doing that job, simply so that this Government can minimise its involvement in social housing. For all of these reasons, there is no possible way that New Zealand First will vote for this bill.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 16:10:06" ></a><strong>Dr PARMJEET PARMAR (National)</strong>: Thank you for the opportunity to take this call on the first reading of the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill. I am taking a short call to support this bill. To that member who just spoke, Denis O'Rourke: yes, people are coming to New Zealand. We are attracting people from all around the world because the economy is doing so well under this National Government. Unemployment is 5.1 percent—below 5.5 percent when compared with a year earlier. Wages are rising faster than inflation. These are the reasons why people are coming to New Zealand. We are attracting international students to come to New Zealand, we are attracting tourists to come to New Zealand, and we are attracting economic migrants who are looking for better opportunities—they are coming to New Zealand. </p><p class="a">It is a contrast to what was happening under the previous Labour Government when people did not want to live in New Zealand because they could not see any scope, and they could not see any opportunities for themselves and their children here. They were moving overseas to live and work, and that is why we did not have this pressure that we are experiencing under this National Government. We are a very fortunate country to be in this position, where people want to come and live here in New Zealand. </p><p class="a">National does not have a blame policy like the New Zealand First Party and the Green Party. Talking about the median house price—like the Green member Metiria Turei, who spoke before, did—this means that there are houses of higher and lower value than the price of $1 million. It does not mean $1 million is the minimum house price; it means it is the median house price. It does not mean that there are no houses available for less than $1 million, or that houses are not available for more than $1 million. </p><p class="a">This Government has been working hard to improve the supply of houses by signing housing accords, by establishing special housing areas, and, also, we are very keen to reform the Resource Management Act. That is why this legislation is important, because this is to extend the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act 2013 so that more special housing areas can be established as appropriate. I support this bill and commend it to the House.</p></div></body>

It is forever continuing to try these band-aid, mop-up bits of legislation to make it look as if it is serious about addressing this very serious issue, which New Zealanders understand is serious. It is trying to make it look like it is addressing the core part of the problem of homelessness and the housing crisis, and it is using mop-up, band-aid legislation to do that. </p><p class="a">I liken it to imagining that there are houses on fire, and the Government is, firstly, denying that they are on fire, and, secondly, rushing to try to put the fire out with half a hose. The Government's mop-up bits—its band-aid legislation—are not even fulsome enough to properly address the emergency status of what is happening, let alone going anywhere near the deeper, fundamental, core problems that are causing more and more people to become homeless. </p><p class="a">This is why, in question time today, John Key could not commit to ending homelessness—it is because he cannot. He does not want to promise that. He could not even say what one of the submitters at our hearing in Kaitāia just last week said to us, which was: "This should be the last generation of this country to be impacted by homelessness." That is a goal—that is a goal. This should be the last generation in this country to experience homelessness—any insecure tenure. That is a goal. Today in question time, New Zealanders, our Prime Minister could not even commit to that. He has left our New Zealanders out in the car, cold; in the garage, crouched up, cold; and at the park, cold—that is what he has done to our country: he has left our people in the cold. And he cannot even promise to get them back in the warmth. He cannot even do that. Today in question time, folks, that is what we confirmed from this Government. </p><p class="a">That is why these failed pieces of legislation are failing. It is because they are not addressing the core roots of the problem. The Government is trying to mop it up to make it seem like it is doing something. This special housing area (SHA) legislation—oh, it went so wrong. The developers asked why they would want to bother ensuring that even 10 percent of housing was affordable—that is all the SHA legislation, even as it is, guarantees as affordable. It is only 10 percent; the developers do not even want to agree to that. They are not into that 10 percent being affordable. </p><p class="a">Now let us look at this word "affordable". It means 75 percent of the median. Does this Government understand that, even at 75 percent of the median for Auckland, it is still not actually affordable? Does the Government get that? New Zealanders do—New Zealanders do, I tell you. This is why real solutions are needed—for example: capital funding, a capital gains tax, banning non-resident sales and buyers of homes in New Zealand, and the Government building affordable housing where our families and our people can pay a weekly amount into the capital of owning their own homes, without needing to have a deposit. Those are real systemic and enduring solutions, not this SHA legislation, which has already failed—it has already failed. So, no, we are not going to support this bill, because it is half a mop and it is half a band-aid. The country is on fire and it is half a water hose. Thank you.</p></div></body>

Mālō e 'fakakoloa 'a Aotearoa 'aki 'e lea faka-Tonga. Happy Tongan Language Week, Mr Assistant Speaker. The theme for this year, 2016, is enriching Aotearoa with the Tongan spirit. </p><p class="a">Thank you so much, Mr Assistant Speaker, for this opportunity to take a short call on the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill. It is unfortunate that we are discussing this bill under urgency, because I believe that housing is such a crucial issue that it should be going through the actual process and we should actually take our time and allow the public to make submissions on this bill. It is legislation being proposed that is the latest string in a fiasco proposed as housing policy under this Minister. </p><p class="a">Having a roof or a home is a basic human right, but, unfortunately, it is a basic human right that is not afforded to so many, to thousands of our people, especially to our children. We know from Otago University that in the 2013 census figures there were at least over 41,000 who are homeless, and we also know from this analysis that 10,000 of them are children under the age of 15. </p><p class="a">I see too many of these families in my office. They come in the cars that they live in. Some of these mothers ring up and say: "I don't have a car, but I'd like a house to live in. Can you please come and help?". Many of our staff members do not really like to go and do house calls, but when you get a phone call and you are talking to a mother with five kids, seven kids, or sometimes nine kids, and they tell you that they do not have a car, they do not even have the bus fare to get to your office, you get in your car and you go and you help those families out. </p><p class="a">Just in the weekend I got a call from one of my teachers in Ōtara. This is a teacher who had been looking after five kids. This teacher no longer taught these five kids, but the eldest of these kids was now 16 years old, and she was attending a school together with her eldest son. This family was homeless. This teacher said that she felt responsible. The son had told her that they had been homeless for quite a while. This family was a working family, but they were made homeless because the landlord sold the property. I see too many of these families that have been homeless because the landlords have decided to sell the house, and there are not enough State houses to help these families. </p><p class="a">It is an indictment on our country, Aotearoa New Zealand, that it takes a family like this to reach out to the member of Parliament, then for the member of Parliament to have media involved, before a family like this actually gets to access a house. This is a fair country. We used to be so proud that we were an egalitarian society—well-known internationally for being an egalitarian society; for looking after our own, especially our vulnerable families—but we live in a day and age when this is no longer the case. </p><p class="a">Just today we were told that the house prices in Auckland are over $1 million. But we also know from the statistics that 80 percent of the houses sold in Ōtara last year—in my electorate of Manukau East—were sold to investors. When we know that Ōtara houses are being sold to investors, what that means is that investors have to recoup their costs. Whom do they recoup these costs from? It is from our tenants and most vulnerable families—the families who can least afford to pay these rents. Six years ago rent was only about $230 for a three-bedroom house in Ōtara. Today, 6 years on, it has doubled. </p><p class="a">So why is it that we are seeing so many homeless families? It is because the rent is out of control. In general, more than 50 percent of people in Auckland rent, but when we look at vulnerable families, we see, for example, that 82 percent of Pacific families rent, either from private landlords or from the State. Is this bill, the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill, which we are discussing under urgency, going to deliver for any of these families? No, I do not think so, because the affordable houses that the Hon Nick Smith talks about are houses that are $500,000 or $600,000 and above, and that is not affordable for many of our vulnerable, poor families. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 16:22:07" ></a><strong>GRANT ROBERTSON (Labour—Wellington Central)</strong>: No one else seems to be bothered to take a call. If there was nothing else to describe Nick Smith as a Minister for Building and Housing and his policies, we have seen two emblems of them today. The first of those is that he is now the "million-dollar Minister". That is Nick Smith's lasting legacy to the people of New Zealand—that the average house price in Auckland is a million dollars. I want to be clear about what that will get you in Auckland: a million dollars in Auckland today will get you a two-bedroom brick-and-tile in Mt Roskill.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Marama Davidson</strong>: Is that all?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>GRANT ROBERTSON</strong>: A two-bedroom brick-and-tile in Mt Roskill is the million-dollar dream of this Minister. That is a disgraceful legacy to New Zealand, to see housing go so far out of the reach of hard-working New Zealanders—the primary school teachers, the firefighters in Auckland who cannot afford to live there anymore. It is a city with a housing market out of control, and for 8 years all we have had from the National Government is denial—a denial that there is a problem; an excuse; a person to blame; an organisation to blame—anyone other than this National Government stepping up and taking responsibility. Today Nick Smith can say "I'm the silver medal winner for New Zealand.", because New Zealand has the second most overvalued properties compared with rents and the second most overvalued properties compared with incomes in the OECD. That is what we have reached under Nick Smith: a housing market that for most young New Zealanders means the Kiwi Dream of owning their own home, being part of a community, and providing security and stability for their families is slipping away.</p><p class="a">The National Government comes to the House today with the second of the emblems of Nick Smith's time: yet another piecemeal, tinkering, small measure that the Government brings forward and then says: "You've got to do this under urgency." It is an emblem of the catalogue of incompetence and of the chaotic and damaging housing policy of Nick Smith, to bring this bill to this House under urgency.</p><p class="a">I want to state right now that the Government should accept a Supplementary Order Paper from Phil Twyford to split these bills in two—to split up Part 1 of the bill, which says that these special housing area provisions need to be extended. This is because—and I will return to this in a minute—there is at least a small amount of value in that proposal, albeit it very small. But Part 2 of the bill—which actually has nothing to do with Part 1 of the bill, and they should not even be together at this point—should go to a select committee. What is the urgency, Dr Smith? What is the urgency for Part 2 of the bill?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: Getting houses built.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>GRANT ROBERTSON</strong>: "Getting houses built.", he says. You have had 8 years and you have not shown any urgency. Why today, on a provision that is significant? The provision is significant because it takes away the rights of certain New Zealanders. It could be justified; we need a debate about that. There is no way that a piece of legislation like this and as important as this should be blithely brought through under urgency.</p><p class="a">I went looking for the regulatory impact statement on this matter—on Part 2 of the bill—and found nothing on the Table of the House. But we do have the departmental disclosure statement on the bill as a whole, and it makes for disturbing reading. That is because Part 2 of this bill changes the process in terms of the right of offer—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: No, it doesn't.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>GRANT ROBERTSON</strong>: Yes, it does. Why are you putting it up, Dr Smith, if it does not change the process? Why is it in the House? Why are we all here? If you are not doing anything, why is it in the law? He does not know, does not have an answer, and has not got a clue about what he is doing.</p><p class="a">What is worse is that in the departmental disclosure statement the Government is required to answer a series of questions—all departmental disclosure statements have to answer these questions. It says: "Part Four: Significant Legislature Features. Compulsory acquisition of private property. 4.1. Does this Bill contain any provisions that could result in the compulsory acquisition of private property?". Answer: "No". That is what the Minister and his department are telling his officials—he says: "No." Is that not precisely what you, Dr Smith, are trying to achieve with the bill—to say to people who may have had a right of offer back that they no longer do?</p><p class="a">Well, if you do not like that one, we will go further down the page in the departmental disclosure statement to where it says: "Significant decision-making powers. 4.6. Does this Bill create or amend a decision-making power to make a determination about a person's rights, obligations, or interests protected or recognised by law, and that could have a significant impact on those rights, obligations, or interests?". The answer from the Minister: "No". He says: "No." That is categorically untrue, Minister. You have misled your Cabinet colleagues, because that is precisely what this provision in Part 2 does—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: It doesn't.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>GRANT ROBERTSON</strong>: —and if it does not, why is it here? Why have you put it in the law?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: Read it.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>GRANT ROBERTSON</strong>: Read it? I have read it, Dr Smith, and what it does under Part 2 is it changes the way in which some people may believe that the Public Works Act applies to them in this law. Now, Dr Smith, this is the problem, because what should be happening at the end of this debate is that this piece of legislation should be going off to a select committee. Maybe, just maybe, we can accept that Part 1 of the bill cannot do that, because—despite being warned by Phil Goff in May that there were going to be problems with the special housing areas and the Auckland Unitary Plan—Dr Smith has waited until 6 September to come to us with an urgent law because the whole provisions around special housing areas expire on 15 September, so maybe Part 1 passes the urgency threshold. Part 2 does not pass the urgency threshold.</p><p class="a">So, Dr Smith, here is your chance: split the bills in two. Part 1 comes through; many parties in this House will be able to support that. Part 2 goes to a select committee, and the public will actually get to make some submissions on a fundamentally important change in law around whether or not there are offer-back provisions under the Public Works Act. The Public Works Act—and everyone in this House will have had some interaction with it during their time as a politician or beforehand—has a hierarchy in it. It has a process for the return of land, or the offer back of land, to the original owners. If that is changing—which, presumably, is the only reason you would put something in a law, because if it is already the law you do not need to change it—that deserves proper scrutiny. That is a major change. That is about people's property rights, which Dr Smith claimed today are not affected by this clause. They quite clearly are, Dr Smith. You have misled your Cabinet colleagues, and it is time to actually have a proper debate about this bill.</p><p class="a">The special housing areas promised so much from Dr Smith. They promised that they were going to be the panacea for Auckland's housing crisis, in particular, and yet we have seen such little action from them—around 1,300 actual houses. During the period of time when National has been in office, the deficit in housing has gone up by over 40,000 houses and 163,000 extra people have arrived in Auckland during that time, and the Government has failed to keep up. In 2016 we are going to see, what, around 9,600 houses built. That is still well below the 13,000 houses that are required. If you look at it on a population basis, we are getting around 6.3 consents for every 1,000 people, yet we need it to be up at around 13 or 14 consents, which is what happened when the Labour Government under Norman Kirk took this seriously—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: Did not.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>GRANT ROBERTSON</strong>: It is exactly what happened. We took this seriously the last time, when Norman Kirk was the Prime Minister, in the 1970s. What we needed—and if we were to be here under urgency, it would be to have a comprehensive housing plan to build affordable homes, to crack down on speculators, and to actually build more State houses and not, as this Government does, avoid doing that because it is, in the words of the <em>Dominion Post </em>today, "fundamentally averse to building … state houses." Those members have got their ideological blinkers on and that is bad enough, but if you add to that pushing through under urgency a fundamental change to the Public Works Act and how it applies, it is a disgrace to use urgency this way, from a failed and hopeless Government.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 16:32:08" ></a><strong>MAUREEN PUGH (National)</strong>: It is my pleasure to take this call on the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill. This is an omnibus bill and yet another tool in National's tool kit in its comprehensive housing plan. There are now 213 special housing areas (SHAs) across New Zealand. They are in Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, Tauranga, the Western Bay of Plenty, Selwyn, Tasman, Nelson, and Queenstown, and they have the capacity to build and provide 70,000 homes. We need to protect these SHAs and provide for more.</p><p class="a">Worthy of note in this bill is that it sets time limits on lodging resource consents and plan variations, which, in turn, encourages developers to begin building in special housing areas quickly. Consents must be lodged within 12 months of an SHA being gazetted. If this bill does not progress, the SHAs listed above will lapse and the developers will need to restart their plan change process under the Resource Management Act. This could delay that housing coming on stream by at least 2 years and, potentially, up to 5 years.</p><p class="a">This Government is serious about building houses, and this bill is an important part of improving the supply of land and providing the tools to get houses built. I commend this bill to the House.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 16:34:54" ></a><strong>CARMEL SEPULONI (Labour—Kelston)</strong>: We are highly opposed—as you will have heard formerly from my colleagues who have spoken, not just from the Labour Party but also from the Green Party and New Zealand First—to the fact that the Government has made the decision to put this bill through under urgency. We have been trying to get some urgency over the housing issue for at least the last 2 years and we have not got any urgency on things that matter, including—can I just mention—the issue of homelessness, where we tried to get the Government to agree to do a cross-party inquiry into this very important issue. Instead, we have had to do it in partnership with the Greens and with the Māori Party because the Government did not see a need for that to be urgent. But here we are today, considering something in urgency, basically because Nick Smith—again—has made a shambles of the housing situation.</p><p class="a">I just want to say—and I have been yelling it out from the backbenches over here—that, actually, I think Nick Smith will go down in history as the worst housing Minister New Zealand has ever had. What a legacy—what a legacy for him to leave here. It is part of a string of fiascos that pass for a housing policy under the Minister, and yet we still have to listen to that Government—every time those members stand up in the House—say that it has a comprehensive housing package. There is no comprehensive housing plan that the National Government has going on. The plan—the only plan—that New Zealand needs from the National Government is a commitment to building houses. We do not need a pipeline and we do not need a consent, because we cannot live in a pipeline and we cannot live in a consent. We need actual houses, and we have not been given them so far.</p><p class="a">Although Labour would vote for the first part, which is extending the housing accords law here, we think it is untenable, actually, to push the second part, with changes to the Public Works Act, through all stages under urgency. If both parts—as we have said earlier—are included in this bill, then we cannot vote for this bill—and, actually, I think my colleague Phil Twyford did put up an amendment trying to split the bill, but that has not been supported. My understanding is that it has not been supported by the National Government. So easy—we could so easily support part of this; we just cannot support the second part—it would be so easy for the Minister to just split it in two so that at least he could get some consensus in the House for part of what he is trying to do. But we cannot commit to the second part because we do believe there needs to be some public scrutiny on that, particularly in respect of what we are dealing with there—that is, basically, changes to the way in which the Public Works Act applies.</p><p class="a">I want to talk just a little bit about where I have seen that specific part of the Public Works Act applied to my own electorate, and that was with regard to the Waterview Connection. We know that as part of the Waterview Connection a whole lot of properties were purchased from Housing New Zealand as part of the Public Works Act process—and also private houses—so that that particular motorway could be built; then, in the end, actually, a whole lot of them were not required. You know, as New Zealanders we can have peace of mind that, actually, the first port of call in terms of offering those houses for purchase back was actually to Housing New Zealand, because it had sold them as part of the Public Works Act process in the first place. Unfortunately, in that situation Housing New Zealand did not purchase the houses back—it should have—Housing New Zealand acted as if there was no need to recoup that housing, and then those houses ended up going up for private sale.</p><p class="a">But we know that if there was a responsible Government, then that measure is actually a very sensible measure to have in place. That housing was not required for the roading project. It should have gone straight back to Housing New Zealand. Housing New Zealand had the opportunity to purchase it back. Unfortunately, in that situation, it did not—but I am happy that at least that safeguard was in place, and I do not want it to be messed with, particularly given that we have not had any time to actually scrutinise what is being proposed here by the National Government. In fact, as some of my colleagues have pointed out, it does not seem like National members have actually had time to scrutinise what is in front of them for themselves. In fact, Nick Smith seems a little bit confused about what is actually in this bill, and we are concerned, actually, that perhaps the way in which Nick Smith has communicated this to his Cabinet is slightly misleading. But, given that this is going through under urgency, we will not have the opportunity to scrutinise it to the extent that we need to.</p><p class="a">Earlier, people who have been on their feet on this side of the House talked about some of the issues that we are facing in respect of housing, and, actually, we have made it really clear that this is a priority for Labour in Opposition and Labour when we are in Government. I just want to say that it has been really disconcerting to see the response that we got from the National Government on a number of issues. Particularly, let us start with the fact it denies there is a housing crisis in the first place. And then, yet, we get responses back from them like the one I got back from the Minister for Social Housing, who states that it takes 155 days to house someone who is homeless—155 days to actually house someone who is homeless—who is living in their car, living in a garage, living under a bush somewhere; it takes that Government 155 days to house them.</p><p class="a">I have had difficulties even getting a definition out of the National Government in respect of what homelessness is. In fact, when I asked the Minister for Social Housing what the definition for homelessness was I got a response on the day that the response was due saying that she needed more time to be able to provide that answer. More time to be able to provide a definition for homelessness? We just have to wonder what the criteria that we are working under are, and whether the Government even knows what is going on. And then we hear, through a University of Otago study, that there are approximately 41,000 - plus people who are homeless in this country and the National Government says that it does not believe that figure—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: It's crap.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CARMEL SEPULONI</strong>: —that that figure is not correct. Oh, actually, I think I just heard Nick Smith say that that figure is crap. Well, actually—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Order! I probably should have pulled the member up, but I do not want it repeated back and forth, thank you.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CARMEL SEPULONI</strong>: Sure. Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. Actually, we see it every day in our electorate offices, particularly those of us who live in electorates that have people who are living on lower incomes. As my colleague Jenny Salesa said before, it is not just those who are on benefits—although we are concerned about those people who are homeless—but there is also a growing number of working poor who cannot afford to put a roof over the heads of their family and are living in cars. That is concerning to us, but what is really concerning is that it does not seem to be concerning to the National Government.</p><p class="a">This bill, as I said earlier, is another step in this shambles that has been the Government's housing accords. It demonstrates, yet again, the Government's incompetence on housing. The Government was well aware that some of the special housing areas could lose their ability to continue under the new Auckland Unitary Plan before the housing accords legislation was even passed—and yet now it is pushing through legislation with only 10 days to go before D-day. This could have been considered in a more responsible way, but the Government has not thought forward, it has not been organised, and here we go again in the chaos that is the National Government's supposed comprehensive housing plan.</p><p class="a">The housing accords have failed to deliver new housing, with only just over 1,000 houses actually completed in Auckland after 3 years, yet the Government now proposes to extend them for another 3 years. They have also been a goldmine for land bankers—I think my colleague Marama Davidson was talking about this before—with only 57 of the 154 special housing areas actually having building consents in them, so far. If the Government was serious about delivering more housing, it would actually adopt Labour's KiwiBuild plan to build—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: It's a joke—it's a joke.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CARMEL SEPULONI</strong>: —100,000 affordable houses. It is not a joke when a political party has a plan to build more houses in the midst of a housing crisis, Nick Smith. That is not the joke. The joke is that that Minister refuses to listen and acknowledge that there is a housing crisis in this country. That is the joke. The joke is that that Minister has brought the bill to the House under urgency because he was not organised enough to get this through the proper channels earlier on, when he should have. That is the joke, Mr Smith.</p></div></body>

This bill is a litmus test as to whether people want houses to be over people's heads or whether people just want to play politics and play rhetoric. The frank choice for this Parliament is that this bill will get more houses built. What I find so extraordinary from members opposite is that they set up inquiries and they demand that the Government takes a state of emergency on housing and puts the whole country into some civil defence crisis, but they are not prepared to come down to this Parliament and support a practical bill that will actually get houses built. But I am not surprised—I am not surprised.</p><p class="a">I will tell you why I am not surprised. Every single time that legislation that will actually get houses built has been before this Parliament, members opposite have voted against it. What happened to the HomeStart scheme? They opposed it. What happened to the fast-tracked unitary plan? They opposed it. What happened in terms of Resource Management Act reform? They opposed it. What happened in terms of the legislation to provide for special housing areas? They opposed it. And now I ask members opposite—and let us talk real facts—how many houses were being built when this Government came to office? The number had dropped to a low of just 12,000 homes across this country. That is the lowest level—the lowest level—of houses that were ever built in my lifetime. The lowest number ever was what this Government inherited. </p><p class="a">Well, let us look at how much housing has grown, because, I will be frank, I am proud of my record. This is a graph of the number of houses built in every year back to 1922. In my first year as housing Minister, the number grew by 21 percent. In my second year as housing Minister, the number grew by 23 percent. In my third year as housing Minister the number grew by another 20 percent, and the latest figures show growth of 29 percent. Here is my challenge: tell me during which Minister's watch there has been faster growth in the number—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Order! I just want to ask Mr Faafoi not to bring the Speaker into the debate, especially in a disreputable way.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: I have got a simple question, Mr Faafoi: name me a Minister under whom there has been stronger growth in the number of houses being built than over the last 4 years.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Carmel Sepuloni</strong>: Over the last 4 years?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: Over any 4 year period—tell me a period when you have had 4 years of more than 20 percent compound growth in the house-build rate. Tell me any name in any period when there has been faster house growth than in the last 4 years. They are silent because they know there has been phenomenal growth in the number of houses being built over the 4 years. In fact, the truth is that there has been a faster increase in the rate of house building over the last 4 years than in any period, going back to 1922. There have been 29,000 homes built in the last year, and that rate continues to grow. </p><p class="a">Then I have the contribution from the member: "Well, Housing New Zealand should get on and build some houses." Well, here are the facts, guys: in the last year 1,100 homes have been completed by Housing New Zealand—1,100 finished; that is not consented, but finished. What was the maximum number of houses that were built during Helen Clark's years? I thought they were the people who loved State housing. Actually, they got less than half that number. The very best number that Labour achieved in a year was 640 homes. Hang on a moment—this Government has built more State houses in the last year than any Government in 25 years. So I ask members opposite why they will not support bills that will get houses built. If they are genuine about wanting to get people out of cars and into houses, why will they not support bills before this House that will actually get houses built?</p><p class="a">Let us be practical. I want to draw your attention to a very specific press release from Sir Noel Robinson—a very credible gentleman. He wants to build 500 houses in Papakura. Well, anybody in this House would know that that is an area where there is very high housing need. Those 500 homes will not be built—will not be built—according to his press release, without this bill. Five hundred homes, quite specifically, will not be built without this bill. Sir Noel Robinson has spent $2 million on developing his site in Bellfield Road in Papakura. He is committed to building affordable houses, and so I ask members on the opposite side of the House whether they want Sir Noel Robinson to build those 500 houses or not. In voting against this bill at the first reading, they are showing themselves to be part of the problem, not part of the solution. </p><p class="a">I want to come, quite specifically, to the issues around the Housing Act, because Governments since 1955 have been doing housing developments under that Act. When those houses have been built, Governments of both National and Labour—and even New Zealand First—persuasions have sold those constructed houses to New Zealanders. There is some doubt—there is a question mark that has been raised—as to whether houses that have been developed by Housing New Zealand, or developed in Weymouth, or built in Hobsonville, have to be offered back to the previous owner. That would be totally contrary to what every Government has done since 1955, and I will tell you why it matters. </p><p class="a">Right now, I am in the private market to secure partners—partners with Māori, partners with building companies—to build thousands of houses on Crown land in places like Manukau, places right through Auckland. Would a private sector partner invest hundreds of millions of dollars if there is a question mark as to whether they can sell those houses that are completed? That is why I say to members opposite that if they are serious—serious—about addressing New Zealand's housing issues and enabling us to build houses on that Crown land, they should support this bill. </p><p class="a">I ask members opposite where they are going to build those KiwiBuild houses they promise. Where? They have said that it will be on Crown land. If they oppose this bill, they are, effectively, saying that they would need to offer those blocks of land back to their previous owners and not be able to develop houses on them. In other words, they could not build the very houses that they promise that they will be able to deliver. So I say again to this Parliament: stop the politicking; support the policies that will actually get houses built for Kiwi families. There is only one answer to homelessness, and that is to build more houses. Parties that want houses built will back this bill.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 16:55:14" ></a><strong>PHIL TWYFORD (Labour—Te Atatū)</strong>: Well, that was like a Punch and Judy show without Judy. That was quite a rant that we heard from the Hon Dr Nick Smith, passionately defending his record. He is much loved by political cartoonists, is Dr Smith. I think it is because drawing him must be such a satisfying task for the nation's political cartoonists. But I am sorry to say to the Minister that he has become, really, a symbol of failure in this Government's housing policy. He has come to embody the fiasco—</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: I regret interrupting the member. I just do want to warn the member interjecting from my right that his interjection is a reflection on me. He is referring to a matter that is solely mine, and the width of this debate was set by Mr Speaker right back at the beginning. It was very clear that it is a broad debate. So I do not want that sort of reflective interjection, thank you.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>PHIL TWYFORD</strong>: This Minister measures his success as building and housing Minister by comparing the rate of residential construction with the depths of the global financial crisis, when demand collapsed in the economy, and, basically, the building industry went dead for at least a couple of years, and many of our skilled tradespeople left the industry and left the country. That is Nick Smith's benchmark for success: the depths of the global financial crisis.</p><p class="a">But notwithstanding all of the bluster that we heard from Dr Smith, it needs to be pointed out that we are still building, in Auckland, fewer houses per year than were being built in 2004—fewer in Auckland than were being built in 2004, and fewer than were being built in the time of Prime Minister Norman Kirk in the mid-1970s. The picture is even more grim if you compare the current build rate with a per-thousand population. Because of the rising population, we are now building fewer houses than at many points over the last 30 years.</p><p class="a">The Auckland Unitary Plan Independent Hearings Panel estimated recently that, under this National Government, the shortfall of dwellings in Auckland has built up to the tune of 42,000 dwellings. That is the scale of the shortage that has built up on Dr Smith's watch. It is currently getting worse by about 4,000 a year, because only about 9,600 new dwellings are being consented annually—you can take 10 percent off that, actually, because the actual build rate is generally about 10 percent less than the consenting rate. So probably only 8,500 dwellings are being built every year in Auckland, when the city needs at least 13,000 just to keep up with population.</p><p class="a">I want to say a couple of things about the special housing areas. Part 1 of this bill extends the special housing areas out—from the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas legislation—by 3 years. So I want to ask the question, really: what is the benefit of the special housing area legislation? We know it is the Government's main policy when it comes to trying to increase the supply of new housing. The special housing areas are only lines on a map—little zones that, basically, attract fast-tracked consenting. That is all they are. There is no guarantee that houses will be built, and we can see from the numbers that, over 3 years, 154 special housing areas have been gazetted but little more than a third of them, actually, have building consents being issued. After 3 years of this policy, little more than a third of them actually have building consents.</p><p class="a">What we can see in the special housing areas is that they have actually been a magnet for land banking. They have encouraged land banking by providing the fast-tracked consenting status. By giving them a kind of special status as special housing areas, they have actually encouraged land banking. You can see one example after another of special housing area land being marketed by real estate agents for land banking—I kid you not. And what did Dr Smith do a couple of months ago when he was asked about land banking in the special housing areas? He said: "Yep, there are 14 special housing areas where they've been given their resource consents. They've got special housing area status, but they haven't even applied for building consents." He promised that he would write a stern letter to those land bankers and threaten them with the full force of—well, I do not actually know what he threatened them with, but he certainly sounded very intent when he was being quizzed about this on television's <em>Q+A</em> programme. It turned out that he wrote only four letters to the land bankers—four letters—and if you read the letter, it was not really a threatening letter to the land bankers; it was much more of a wet bus ticket where he encouraged them to go and have a conversation with the council. That must have been pretty scary for those land bankers!</p><p class="a">The other thing about the housing accords that we know is that very few of them have any real affordability requirements. Len Brown and the Auckland Council, basically, browbeat the Government, in the Auckland Housing Accord, into giving them the power to require that up to 10 percent of new dwellings be affordable, but, actually, in most of the other housing accords around the country—in Wellington, in Nelson, and in Tauranga—Nick Smith and his officials point-blank refused to allow affordability requirements to be included in those housing accords. So, as a result, very few affordable houses have been built, because in an overheated and undersupplied market what happens, of course, is that the developers choose to build more expensive houses so that they can make bigger profits.</p><p class="a">So the special housing areas have been underwhelming. They have made very little difference. No one can say with any certainty whether or not they have actually resulted in a net increase in the number of houses that have been built. At best, the special housing areas might have accelerated the development of some houses that were already in the pipeline.</p><p class="a">We would vote for Part 1 of this bill to extend the special housing areas, in order to ease the transition problems caused by the poor drafting of the original housing accord and special housing area legislation, which, as has been pointed out in this debate, would cause some cost uncertainty and delay to eight developers in those special housing areas in Auckland unless this legislation is extended. If the bill did only that, then we would have been willing to support it. It is not much, it is no genuine contribution to fixing the housing crisis, and it is resulting in very few houses actually being built and even fewer affordable ones, but we would have been willing to support it, as modest as it is. But we cannot vote for this bill while it includes Part 2, a provision that would take away rights that people have under the Public Works Act, that former owners would have, to have Government land that is being re-designated for the purposes of State housing—it is taking away their right for that land to be offered back to them.</p><p class="a">It was very, very illuminating in the first reading debate of this bill when Grant Robertson pointed out that if there was no change required, if the Government already had that right, unfettered, to be able to use the State housing designation to either dispose of land or to use it in housing developments and not have to offer it back to former owners under the Public Works Act—if the State already has that right, why are we here? Why is it in this bill? Why is this bill being rammed through under urgency?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Jono Naylor</strong>: So that you can understand it. </p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>PHIL TWYFORD</strong>: Well, I just think the member is being frivolous, if not insulting. There is no reason that we have heard offered in this debate, from the Minister for Building and Housing or from National Government members, why Part 2 is in this bill. The Government says it is clarifying the powers it has to do this, to ignore the offer-back provisions in the Public Works Act, but if that right already exists, if the Government already has that power, why is it legislating it? Why is it pushing it through under urgency? We believe that when you take away people's property rights, as this bill does, then you should at least do it in a careful, deliberate, and thoughtful way and subject the bill to the normal scrutiny, expert advice, and public submissions that you get in a select committee hearing. Why is this bill being rammed through under urgency?</p><p class="a">Finally, I want to say that this bill epitomises the kind of piecemeal tinkering that has characterised the Government's so-called comprehensive housing agenda, which is not comprehensive at all. It is simply a whole lot of reactive, half-baked policies that are making very little difference.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 17:05:51" ></a><strong>ALFRED NGARO (National)</strong>: I rise to take a call on the second reading of this bill. I just realised, as the member Phil Twyford was speaking—I came up with a good fund-raising idea for Mr Phil Twyford. Because of all the flip-flopping, he should have a pair of jandals called "Phil's Flip-Flops". It sort of goes on and off, on and off, as a fund-raising idea. Why? Because the reality is that that is what we have, even from that speech. In the first reading, Labour members stood up and said: "We oppose this bill. However, if we separate the bill, we can support the first part but not the second part of the bill."</p><p class="a">The first part of the bill is, obviously, the amendment to the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act, which would allow for another 3-year period, and yet Phil Twyford went on in his speech to continue to bag all of the things about the special housing accord Act in itself and what it enables: the fast-tracking of consenting to allow for rezoning for those particular areas. On the one hand, Labour says it supports it; but on the other hand: "Hang on, it's not that great. It doesn't work. But we'll go back again and we'll support it." If he would just make up his mind—but I actually think that greater than Havaianas could be "Phil's Flip-Flops". That is a good fund-raising idea.</p><p class="a">That is the sort of speech that we are hearing from the other side. He knows—when it came to the LVRs, the loan-to-value ratios, he said: "Not a good idea." All of a sudden, Labour members came in: "It's a great idea." Metropolitan urban limits—not a good idea, but all of a sudden it is a great idea. Devolving stock into the community housing providers—what happened? "It's a great idea", and then "Not a good idea."—flip-flop, flip-flop.</p><p class="a">This is a comprehensive plan. The special housing areas are not the silver bullet, but they add to the tool box that we know is important in addressing these issues. As for the tool box—why? The Productivity Commission report states that "consenting and the slow process, we know is critical. We know it's not the whole but is one part of the reasons why we need to build."</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Denis O</strong><strong>'</strong><strong>Rourke</strong>: Table this comprehensive plan. Don't just talk about it—show us it.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>ALFRED NGARO</strong>: So, Mr Denis O'Rourke—you want to say "Show me the money. Show me the houses.", so let us talk about this. In June of this year, 2016, the special housing areas—let us talk about the results: 1,300 homes have been completed, 2,200 building consents have been issued, 2,458 new sections have been created, and 7,170 new sections have been granted resource consents, out of the 154 special housing areas in Auckland. We know that is good news, we know it is making a difference—26 have been built on capacity of 29,800, 15 have earthworks under capacity, 5,300, and 88 are in the same stage of the planning process. That is not just talk; those are results. They are facts. That is what is happening.</p><p class="a">I know that it is not happening faster; we want it to happen quicker as well. Actually, the points that were made by previous speakers, that only 25 out of the 154 special housing areas have not had consents or plan changes lodged, 16 of which were declared in February and May of this year—hence the reason why, when the question was "Why do we need to put this under urgency?", we need to ensure that we extend the period of time, that is critically important to this bill, and we think that is important as well.</p><p class="a">Here is the other thing about what it will do: it will allow for plan variation for applications that have begun but are not completed under the current Act to continue when a proposed district plan becomes operative. We know that the unitary plan, now that it has finally gone through the Auckland Council, allows for that; hence the reason why the extension will imply that as well. The other thing that I think is important, which maybe gets missed, is that it will also encourage and impose the fact that the consenting and the lodging of those consents for housing must be done within a 12-month period of time. We think that is important. It will be able to fast track the ability to say that if you are going to apply for a special housing accord area, then you need to enact that within a certain period of time. We think that is important as well.</p><p class="a">Why the 3 years? House prices continue to rise and the supply of housing continues to lag behind demand. The extension of this by 3 years will allow for additional special housing areas to be established, and it will provide a faster housing development and increase housing supply. We think that is critically important as well.</p><p class="a">I just want to finish off my speech here, in the second reading, by talking about some of the results that we think are critically important around this area. Again, this is part of a suite of tools that we think are important. There are 85,000 new houses to be built in this term of Parliament, and 40 houses are built every working day. When the National Party came into Government in 2008, there were, on average, 10 houses being built every day. We know that it is making a difference, exactly at 40 houses being built every working day in Auckland. This is four times what it was when National was elected in 2008. Over 2,000 homes are to be built on Crown land. We have freed up land in Auckland and in Christchurch. We know that it is making a difference. We think this is important. We see it as pragmatic.</p><p class="a">I know that Mr Phil Twyford supports it, because he has said so. It is only the second party that does not support it. But when we talk about this bill and what it is enabling us in regard to building more—to the demand—we think it is making a difference. I commend this bill to the House.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 17:11:17" ></a><strong>CARMEL SEPULONI (Labour—Kelston)</strong>: That speech was a little bit disappointing. I just want to point out the fact that, firstly, I do not understand what he was talking about with regard to saying that my colleague Phil Twyford has flip-flopped. He has not flip-flopped on anything. We have been quite assertive in respect of our housing plans. The same cannot be said for that side of the House. Alfred Ngaro talked about some random fund-raiser that Phil Twyford should have. Well, actually, the fund-raiser that that member has been involved in is selling our State houses. What kind of a fund-raiser is that, Alfred Ngaro? He should be ashamed of himself. I am sure there are a whole lot of people in the electorate of Te Atatū, which he is trying to win off the current electorate MP Phil Twyford, who do not support the decisions that he has made, alongside his Government, in respect of selling State housing that has been built up over generations, by generations of New Zealanders. He sold out. OK, Mr Deputy Speaker, back to the bill.</p><p class="a">Can I just say that one of the really disappointing parts of this, given the fact that we have been given the responsibility by the public—we are elected representatives and we are here to scrutinise legislation, to make sure that we are giving New Zealanders the best deal possible. It is really concerning that we have only half a regulatory impact statement here.</p><p class="a">There are two parts to the bill. We have made it really clear that we do not have any major issue with Part 1, apart from the fact that it has not been that effective to date, but that does not mean we would necessarily throw it out. But we do have major reservations about Part 2. The only regulatory impact statement we have is for Part 1 of the bill, which we on this side of the House would have no problem voting for if it was split off by Part 2, which actually does need further scrutiny.</p><p class="a">I want to talk a little bit about Part 2 and speak to some of the reservations that we have. Basically, with Part 2 we are looking at the Public Works Act and the offer-back changes. Clause 10 of the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill amends section 15 of the Housing Act to state that sections 40 to 42 of the Public Works Act do not apply to the sale of State housing land. A specific subclause states that this change does not affect the right of first refusal under any Treaty of Waitangi claims settlement or collective redress Act or deed. Minister Smith has advised us that the purpose of this is to prevent a situation where the Crown develops housing on land and, upon completion, a person decides to use their offer-back rights to purchase the completed development. </p><p class="a">The Minister has given us his assurance—I am not sure how much that counts for—that this provision could be used only for developments and would not be used for the sale of existing State housing stock held by Housing New Zealand. The Minister has argued that this change enhances the rights of Māori, as the right of first refusal is protected and the removal of the offer-back provision means that there is greater ability to negotiate agreements with Māori for housing developments.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Meka Whaitiri</strong>: How many have entered into agreements?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CARMEL SEPULONI</strong>: My colleague Meka Whaitiri has asked how many Māori, how many iwi, have entered into agreements. But I also want to say that on that side of the House the Minister is arguing that this enhances the rights of Māori. The Māori members on this side of the House, and the Labour Party in general, do not think that is the case, so we will not be supporting it. But also, let us look across the floor. We did notice, at the end of the first reading, who did not support this bill. Not only did the Labour Party, New Zealand First, and the Green Party vote against this bill at first reading but the Māori Party did too. That is the political party, in partnership with the Government, that is supposed to be advocating for Māori. So here they are saying that, actually, when they vote against it—what that says to us is that they do not believe that that enhances the rights of Māori either. We on this side of the House already knew that was the case, but it reinforces that that is the fact.</p><p class="a">Labour has concerns that this provision will not give Māori the protection that the Minister says it does, and that the provision could be used to make it easier for the Government to go through its State house sell-off. The Government's claim that this is merely a clarification is tenuous, given the Ngāti Whātua incident. As part of the Government's Auckland surplus Crown land programme, the Government sought to use the Housing Act to circumvent Ngāti Whātua's right of first refusal under the Tāmaki Collective deed of settlement. Ngāti Whātua challenged this in court, and the Government ended up settling the case in order to stop the legal action. That the Government was willing to settle in that case shows the law is far from certain, and this situation could apply to an offer-back provision, just as it could for Ngāti Whātua's right of first refusal.</p><p class="a">We cannot support a provision like this going through under urgency. We need it to be properly scrutinised. It is disgusting that the Government has tried to circumvent the proper process here by not allowing it to go to a select committee and by trying to wrap it up. The Government does have a habit of doing this—putting something that we will not support or that we do not want to support, and that it knows we will not want to support, alongside something that we would not mind supporting, in an attempt to try to get us to sell out and, basically, agree to the whole thing. In this situation, we are not going to do that, I say to the National Government.</p><p class="a">We have been really sensible with our advice and with our proposal, on this side of the House, by saying to the Government to just split the bill in two. Split the bill in two, and then, even though we have some reservations about Part 1, we can support Part 1, but we cannot support Part 1 with Part 2 alongside it and with that being part of the deal. It is a dodgy deal, and we will not be supporting it.</p><p class="a">It was disappointing to hear Nick Smith at the beginning of this second reading debate on the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill, because he seemed to take his whole 10 minutes, or at least 9 minutes and 55 seconds of his 10 minutes, just trying to justify his track record. What that says to us on this side of the House is that he is feeling really sensitive right now. I am sure that even some of his colleagues are a little bit critical of the fact that he has done very little to address the housing issues that we face in this country. I am sure that his colleagues are coming under pressure from some of their constituents as well. When looking at some of the developments that have or have not happened under this National Government, those members should be a little bit concerned about what is happening in their electorates.</p><p class="a">Actually, it is quite timely that the New Plymouth MP is here, because one of those developments is in his electorate. Eight years ago the New Plymouth community was told that it was going to get a redevelopment, that Marfell was going to be redeveloped. Over that time it has had houses pulled out, it has got houses that have been boarded up, and now, 8 years later, nothing is happening there. Eight years later there is no additional housing. There is less housing than there was 8 years ago. When we put in an Official Information Act request to try to find out where the Government is at in respect of this housing development, what we got back was a report that says that, actually, it has decided there is no real need for any more State housing in this area and also it could not find a partner to partner with, so the Government has decided that this probably will not go ahead.</p><p class="a">Actually, in the context of the housing crisis that we face in New Zealand, with over 41,000 people homeless, and in the context locally there, or the emergency shelter telling me it has had a 33 percent increase in the last year in people needing emergency shelter because they are homeless, I find it really difficult to comprehend that that member for New Plymouth and that National Government can say that there is no need for any further Housing New Zealand development in that area, and to leave it empty, like a ghost town. If you go there it is so eerie. We know that there are so many families that do need homes in that area, but they have been neglected by their local member, Jonathan Young. They have been neglected by the National Government, which continues to make excuses for not building houses, when all it needs to do is build them.</p><p class="a">So my advice to Nick Smith is to get rid of the pipeline, get rid of the consents, get rid of the anger that he is clearly carrying and the sensitivities that he is carrying about the poor job that he has done in his role, and actually just get on with building some houses. That is what we proposed on this side of the House. The National Government would do itself a service if it just picked up Labour's KiwiBuild policy.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 17:20:24" ></a><strong>JONO NAYLOR (National)</strong>: I was privileged enough to sit down at a wedding a couple of years ago, and I happened to be sitting next to a mutual friend who was a builder in Auckland. The wedding was in Palmerston North, but he was down there from Auckland for the wedding, and I said to him: "What are the challenges that you really think are facing us, in terms of the challenges that we're facing with rising Auckland housing prices and otherwise?". He said it was pretty simple to him: it was the restriction of supply brought about by the changes that the Auckland City Council had made to the district plan. He said that what we do need to do is get the process moving a lot quicker, and get it so that we can actually get more houses built. </p><p class="a">In 2013 we had the special housing areas put in place, and what that enabled us to do was—as a short-term measure at that time—fast track housing development and address those constraints on housing supply. It has been successful in that, to the point that we are actually seeing a huge number of houses built compared with what was happening before those housing areas were put in place. We have seen a huge number of consents being processed since those were put in place. It does not just happen instantly—that houses are magically built. I know that those members on the other side of the House think they can have a policy where they wave a magic wand and houses will simply appear, but it does take a process. </p><p class="a">These special housing areas have been successful in speeding up the process. There is still a need for this to continue over another 3 years. So, quite succinctly, the primary purpose of this bill is to extend that for a longer period of time so that we can remove that constraint on housing supply in Auckland and help get this moving a lot better for those people in Auckland.</p></div></body>

He can stand there and argue about history all he likes; New Zealand will look on his time as Minister—his history—and rightly judge his failings as a housing Minister against the record that he has created. For all of the posturing and the shouting that goes on, that is his record, and what is his response to that record? His response is this bill: a continuation of a failed policy in Auckland, and the removal of property rights from a wide range of New Zealanders, none of whom he could identify when asked about that. </p><p class="a">So his record of failure will continue, and it would just be a usual political issue, I guess, that you would expect of this National Government, except that it is not Nick Smith who suffers; it is thousands and thousands of New Zealand families, young New Zealanders, and elderly New Zealanders, who are all looking for secure, decent, and affordable homes to live in. In a country as rich, beautiful, and resourceful as ours, this Government has somehow driven our housing to the worst possible state we could expect, where so many New Zealanders can now not afford to rent a home or to buy a home. That is the record of Nick Smith, the other two housing Ministers appointed to oversee the debacle, and this National Government as a whole. </p><p class="a">I do want to just, in my time in the second reading—time that we would have spent, had any of this gone to a select committee, talking about the effects of this legislation on New Zealanders. We would have heard submissions from people involved in speculation: people who are developers, speculators, and investors. We would have heard from families who live around these areas who are concerned about the extent to which they were locked out of consultation because of the fast-track consent process that is built into the special housing area legislation. We would have heard from those who had provided land to the State for housing areas and other public works, who were going to be declined the ability to have the offer back—so who would not be offered back the land that they had gifted or provided to the State—and about the effect of this bill on them. We would have been able to make a much better assessment of the impacts of this legislation on New Zealanders, because we would have talked with New Zealanders about the bill and its impact. </p><p class="a">That is what the select committee process is for. That is the core of the democratic approach to legislation that we have built in this country—that we in this room might make the final decisions, but we do it after consulting with the country, which is impacted by the decisions that we make. That is our core function as members of this House of Representatives—that we go out and speak with our people about the laws that we are intending to pass. But, of course, that is not happening with this legislation, because, despite the fact that these are substantive issues and we could have spent some time talking with New Zealanders about them, National will not allow those voices to be heard. National has shut down the debate with the public about the impact of the special housing areas and the need for real solutions to the housing crisis. National shut down—or tried to shut down—the homelessness inquiry. The Opposition took that on board itself and went out and spoke with New Zealanders, and now National is trying to shut down any real analysis of the impact of the special housing areas on New Zealanders—their failings, and even, potentially, their advantages. </p><p class="a">So when we make decisions about this bill today, National can be assured that it does not know what the effect of this bill will be. National members will vote for this legislation not knowing what the impact will be on New Zealanders, because they have deliberately chosen not to listen to New Zealanders' views. That is the value that the National Government holds for our core democratic processes here. The National Government does not want to hear from New Zealanders about the impact of this legislation; hence we are in urgency for this bill.</p><p class="a">I just want to put on the record the three Supplementary Order Papers (SOPs) that the Green Party is putting forward on this legislation, as we move from this debate into the Committee stage. Just very briefly—we will go into them in more detail in the Committee stage of this bill. The first of the SOPs deletes clause 10, which is the clause that relates to the disposal of State land. That is the clause that will mean that people will not be offered back the land that they have given to the State for a public purpose. We want to delete the clause to protect New Zealanders' property rights where they have provided land to the State for a particular purpose but this National Government does not want to give it back to them. </p><p class="a">There is a second SOP, which amends section 14 of the original legislation. Section 14 of the original legislation defines a qualifying development. Section 14(1)(d) says that a qualifying development will not contain less than a certain percentage of affordable housing. It is a little bit oblique as to what that percentage is, and it is certainly oblique as to what the definition of affordable is. So my SOP will change the original legislation to say that, in effect, the definition of affordable housing is a price at, or less than, four times the median household income. Four times the median household income—it is described as a "median multiple" in economic language—is a way of describing affordability in a technical way. It allows for some flexibility in price because it is related both to income, the median household income, and to the price of housing. Four times the median household income has been supported, actually, by the Minister for Building and Housing, Nick Smith, as being about right for an affordable house. But there is no obligation in the special housing areas for homes to be provided at or below that price, and that needs to be changed.</p><p class="a">Finally, the third SOP will change this bill to allow for the eight current developers and the eight special housing areas in Auckland to continue with their consent application process but will not allow for any further special housing areas to be developed. The reason for that is we must not allow this failed policy to continue in Auckland until there are provisions to stop land banking. Unless there are provisions to stop land banking, allowing more special housing areas in Auckland will simply drive up prices, create wealth for land bankers and speculators, and not deliver actual affordable homes for New Zealanders to live in. </p><p class="a">So we have three SOPs on the Table. They deal with the core concerns that the Green Party has with this bill. We invite members to consider seriously those SOPs and to support them if they agree with us about those concerns. We will at least try to fix this legislation even though National has done such an appalling job initially. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 17:32:34" ></a><strong>DENIS O</strong><strong>'</strong><strong>ROURKE (NZ First)</strong>: I want to begin by taking a look at the speech given by the "Minister of Houselessness", Nick Smith, because nowhere in his speech does he say why another 3 years of special housing areas (SHAs) without Government investment in land-purchasing development, in Auckland in particular, could work. Nowhere does he say in his speech how another 3 years of SHAs, while low-quality open-door immigration is taking place, could possibly work—because that is what is happening. Seventy-thousand people per year net are coming into this country—a number that is equivalent to the size of a city like Nelson coming into this country—but there is no care about the fact that they are going to drive demand for housing, drive up prices, and drive up rents. Nowhere in the Minister's speech was there any reference to the problems caused by overseas purchasers, who, in this country, are still free to buy land, to speculate, and to land bank. Nowhere were any of those issues referred to in the Minster's speech.</p><p class="a">He just does not care—and the truth is that National actually has no strategy whatsoever that deals with those issues, or any other. Its members' pretence that they have a comprehensive housing strategy is utterly ludicrous. Nobody in this country believes that, and the more they say it the more they will show how dishonest they are being about all of that—and that is the truth of it. The truth is that the National Party under the likes of Holyoake, for example, used to be the party for a "property-owning democracy"—those were his words—in New Zealand. But no more—no more. This is not that National Party; this is some neo-liberal monster that is no longer fit to govern this country.</p><p class="a">I also want to talk about the Māori Party. Why are its members not speaking in this debate? Why is it not attacking National, and why is it not actually fighting this fight? I cannot understand that, because this legislation, which is being fast tracked today through all of its stages, is aimed at flogging off State houses and is failing to provide a strategy for the building of new homes in New Zealand, whether for purchase or for rent. It is doing so without consultation or proper scrutiny through the select committee process. So I want to hear from the Māori Party members on all of these things because I think the Māori Party is speaking, if it is speaking at all, with a forked tongue. On the one hand it promotes Treaty rights and says it will protect Treaty rights for Māori in this country, but it is failing here and now to fight against a bill that actually removes those Treaty rights because it removes the offer-back provisions, which would otherwise be claimable under current legislation. Irrespective of the Minister's claims that that is not the case, that is actually the truth about the matter. So I want to hear more from the Māori Party members, and I want to hear them show up like the rest of us and fight against this bill. They are not doing so and I deplore that.</p><p class="a">The Minister has also claimed that he is just clarifying the law when it comes to those offer-back provisions and he says there is no actual law change. Well, if it is necessary to pass this bill to amend the law, then—hello—it must be a law change; therefore, the Minister can only be wrong that the Minister is not attempting to change the law to make sure that those offer-back provisions can never apply. That is what New Zealand First objects to, it is what the Māori Party should be objecting to, and it is what other parties object to.</p><p class="a">The bill is a panic measure by a Minister not on top of his portfolio—and when did this Minister suddenly realise that time is running out for special housing areas? Why, within 10 days of the termination date, is he suddenly bringing this bill to the House if there is a comprehensive housing strategy? Surely it would be a better strategy than that—if there was one—but we all know that there is not one. What there is instead is plenty of evidence of a failed strategy. In fact, there is no strategy at all and plenty of evidence of an absence by this Government of any new ideas at all. All it can come up with is an expansion of a current, failed policy, which over 3 years has actually delivered only 1,300 houses—less than a drop in the bucket as far as Auckland is concerned. So there it is: a panic measure to do little or nothing and to crush people's rights in terms of the offer-back provisions along the way.</p><p class="a">Just to summarise New Zealand First's position: first of all, it believes that there is no justification for the law change—and that is what it is—to remove the offer-back provisions. There is no need for that whatsoever. All it does is to feed on this Government's panic and need to be seen to be doing something. That is not in the interests of New Zealand; it is certainly not in the interests of people who actually might claim those rights and might claim them for very good reasons. That is what a democracy is about. It is about protecting people's rights—and that is not what this Government is doing. It is doing the exact opposite and it is not good enough.</p><p class="a">Secondly, the need is not only to increase the time for the SHAs to work—if they ever do—but for the Government to actually invest in the purchase of land and in the development of land, and not just leave it to private developers to do so. The reason why that is so important and why that is a core part of New Zealand First's housing policy is that the private market will never meet the needs of New Zealanders in this day and age, as far as housing is concerned. The Government must take part, with direct investment and direct development of housing in New Zealand, especially in Auckland, so that we get enough housing, on time, in the right place, and developed in a way that people can afford, with modestly sized houses saleable at modest prices and with Government assistance to purchase.</p><p class="a">New Zealand First's policy is to sell sections over 25 years, allowing a purchaser to get a first mortgage to build their own home. That is just a common-sense policy—but do not ask this Government to listen to common sense. All it wants to do is to continue with its failed policies that are never going to work. So we in New Zealand First oppose both parts of this bill, unlike the Labour Party, which I now hear is quite happy to support the first part but not the second. I am disappointed in that, because I would have hoped that the Labour Party would have seen that, actually, you need to do more than just have failed SHAs; you need to have Government investment. Labour has said that; yet why did it say to this House that it would support the first part of the bill?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: It's better than nothing.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>DENIS O</strong><strong>'</strong><strong>ROURKE</strong>: It is better than nothing? It is nothing. It is not better than nothing, Mr Twyford; it actually is nothing. So the Labour Party is supporting nothing. That is wonderful. Well, I think the Labour Party should take another look at all this. The Labour Party should take another look at why it would support the first part. We in New Zealand First do not. We will not have it. We insist on much better than that. We insist on a policy that does not just provide an extension of a time frame for a failed policy. We want to see Government investment. We want to see real commitment by this Government to housing in this country. That is why we will not support it: because we want much better. And we want people's rights to be protected, as well. We will not vote for this bill, because it does not do either thing that it proposes to do in a way that we could possibly support, and New Zealanders should not accept that either.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 17:42:35" ></a><strong>Dr PARMJEET PARMAR (National)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, for this opportunity to take a call to speak on the second reading of the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill. I am taking this call to support this bill. First, I want to congratulate the Minister, the Hon Nick Smith, for his dedication to improving housing supply and affordability. We know the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act 2013 was meant to be a short-term measure to fast track housing development, and that is because we are committed to addressing the issue of housing supply and affordability. These issues of housing supply and affordability are not unique to us. Yes, these issues that we are facing here in New Zealand are not unique to us. These issues are actually a sign of a country doing well—a sign of a strong, growing economy. Yes, these issues are signs of a strong, growing economy.</p><p class="a">I am a list MP based in Mt Roskill, so my interest is in Auckland. Along with other parts of the country, Auckland has made significant progress since starting its housing accord. Since the start of the Auckland housing accord, 33,000 sections have been created and dwellings consented—that is 33,000 in Auckland. So the extension of the Act is important because it is about housing supply and affordability, it is about keeping that momentum going, and it is about allowing the transition to the unitary plan in a smoother manner.</p><p class="a">The unitary plan is important to Auckland, and the independent hearings panel did a huge job. It was a huge task. It did it in time, which was great. The unitary plan is crucial for Auckland's future. We want to see this momentum keep going, and it is really important that we support housing supply and affordability because this industry, through construction of residential places, is not just about housing supply and affordability but is also about supporting the creation of several jobs.</p><p class="a">If the Labour Party, the Green Party, and the New Zealand First Party are keen on stabilising house prices, then they should support this bill. On this side, we are fully committed. I support this bill and commend it to the House. Thank you.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 17:44:59" ></a><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: The next call is a split call.

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 17:45:03" ></a><strong>MARAMA DAVIDSON (Green)</strong>: So, yes, I am here for the second reading. I am still not supporting the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill—that has not changed.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Metiria Turei</strong>: It's only been an hour.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MARAMA DAVIDSON</strong>: I know. Actually, by the way, before I carry on, who was it who riled up the Minister for Building and Housing? Was it you, Phil? I think it might have been Carmel or Denis. Actually, it was probably Metiria. Who riled him up? Someone riled him up. He got up and he felt it necessary to defend the houses being built and the consents. He is such a good Minister, he got up and said: "But look at the houses I built; look at the consents I agreed to." Those are his measurements of success. Those are not measurements of success. That is not an indicator of how well our country is doing, when you get up and have a little rant about how many houses you have built—just a raw number; it was not even in any context. He did not even talk about the number of State houses that the Government has either flogged off and not replaced or, in comparison, the number that have been left to rot and are currently empty.</p><p class="a">If we had gone through the proper democratic process for this bill, we would have heard from submitters. We would have heard from people, including those like the ones that the Greens and Labour and the Māori Party heard from in our homelessness inquiry. They were very clear when they said that all of the Government's proposals to date, all the of the Government's actions to date, and any of the proposals—including the little panic one we had yesterday from the Minister Paula Bennett to try to sort of make her look sympathetic to us wrapping up our homelessness inquiry—were inadequate. We would have heard submitters saying how woefully, woefully inadequate these band-aid attempts are, including this legislation.</p><p class="a">So because we have not heard from them, I wanted to make sure that I brought their voices and their say into this House of Representatives. As my co-leader Metiria Turei just pointed out, that is what we are. We are supposed to be representative of our country, not just of developers and not just of overseas speculators, whom this Government is continuing to enable to build more wealth, while our own beautiful people, our beautiful people whom I love—do you love them, Government? Do you love our people?—are the ones in garages, crowding in houses, or just even renting homes that they could easily be shoved out of at any time. You know why? Because the housing market is amazing! Owners—because of this Government—are able to flick off a house in Auckland and also give as little as 90 days' notice to be able to do that to any family, to any tenants, and to any renters, because they will get a massive profit. So it is preferable to be able to shove our people, our beautiful New Zealanders, out of their rental homes and out of their secure places rather than to actually allow houses to be a home where people can put down roots.</p><p class="a">This bill does not do anything to address that—this bill does not. In actual fact, the attempt to specifically address land banking in the special housing areas only goes so far as to impose a time limit for consent applications—that is it. It does not actually put any time limit on the actual building—just for getting a consent in. It is a half again: half mop, half band-aid; a half-a-fire hose attempt at fixing this crisis.</p><p class="a">Just very quickly, in my last minute, even the Cabinet papers admit that this was a rush, because the regulatory impact statement did not even cover the entire bill—that is how rushed this was. Also, Mr Smith, the Minister, oversold this to his own Cabinet. He said that if this bill was not rushed through, it was going to prevent 3,000 homes from being built; then this morning he had to concede that that figure was actually 2,000. What is going on? What is going on, Minister? I do not know what is going on—you are just overselling legislation to your own Cabinet. I will just leave it there. Thanks.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 17:49:52" ></a><strong>DAVID SEYMOUR (Leader—ACT)</strong>: I rise on behalf of the ACT Party in support of this bill. Was it not fascinating to listen to the last minute of the speech by the member who just resumed her seat, Marama Davidson, when she actually got on to addressing the bill, instead of being a bundle of self-righteous fury with nothing constructive to add, no solutions, and no real understanding of what is being debated by other members? </p><p class="a">What I would like to address is the fact that these housing markets that we have in New Zealand are dysfunctional. The number of houses built in Auckland in the past decade is 20 percent fewer than in the 1990s, despite very strong price signals that the supply of housing in Auckland needed to rise. That is a dysfunctional market. Unfortunately, over a long period of time—8 years now—this Government has done what the Government before it did: nothing substantial to change the dynamics of that market. These special housing areas, I am sorry to say, are an island of fantasy in a sea of dysfunctional markets. They symbolise a belief that the Government can somehow wish away the dynamics that have led to dysfunction in our housing markets in a few small areas, and suspend all of the things that it has not fixed anywhere else. </p><p class="a">Of course, if the Government was serious, there would be serious Resource Management Act reforms, serious reform of the laws around building and land use planning, and a serious consideration of the fiscal incentives that councils have. At the moment, councils get most of the cost of development while central government gets most of the revenue. So it is not surprising that councils are unwilling to do, or allow, a great deal of building in their jurisdictions, or that we have a shortage of supply—an inelastic supply—of housing, rising prices, and all of the social, economic, and financial problems that that creates. </p><p class="a">It is with some regret that we sit under urgency supporting this bill, which is really tacking on this—should we say—an island of fantasy in a sea of dysfunctional housing markets tonight, in order that we can carry on with the few projects that have actually succeeded. This is not to mention the various perverse incentives that have come out of the special housing areas to date. </p><p class="a">Part 2 is considerably more concerning. If Part 1 is merely not very effective, then Part 2 of this bill, both in terms of property rights and in terms of procedure, should be of great concern to New Zealanders. What it says is that this Government, or any future Government—and, colleagues, sometimes that is one thing we need to think about—can take land, acquired, perhaps, under the Public Works Act for one purpose, and then develop housing on it and dispose of it without any of the normal safeguards of right of first refusal to the original owner. I am a bit surprised that the Labour Party and the Green Party and New Zealand First are opposed to that; generally speaking, they want the Government to be developing housing through any means necessary. Oddly enough, it is the National Government—from the party of free enterprise, occasionally—which appears to be proposing that the Government be able to ride roughshod over normal property rights in order to build low-cost housing. </p><p class="a">It is a topsy-turvy world, but I think one thing that is going to be very clear is that the Committee stage of this debate, or of this compressed reading, is going to be very, very interesting. I am looking forward to seeing what Supplementary Order Papers are sitting on the Table that might ameliorate the difficulties we have, as a House, with aggregating New Zealanders' property rights in due process under the Public Works Act in a single night of urgency, particularly when members on my immediate left think hard about what that might mean in the hands of future Governments. I am not quite sure where that Committee stage is going to land, but it is somewhere that members need to focus their attention very carefully, because to start aggregating safeguards of New Zealanders' property rights in the middle of the night under urgency is not the way that the ACT Party believes we should be doing things in this House. </p><p class="a">So with those comments, I will resume my seat, supporting this bill in its second reading, but I think there is the potential for things to evolve a little bit as the night goes on. Thank you.</p></div></body>

We have heard a lot of rhetoric today, and in recent weeks—even in recent months—about the need to provide more housing in New Zealand. Yet, when this opportunity is before the House on an issue we are all agreed on, the need to provide more housing, the Opposition cannot bring itself to support a bill that provides the very tools that we will see maintaining the momentum, making land available, and getting houses built.</p><p class="a">In a strong and growing economy, which is managed ably by this National-led Government, we are seeing more and more New Zealanders staying home and coming home—such is their confidence in this country now, and in this Government.

We understand the need to ensure that this bill is passed through this House, because we want to support more Kiwis getting into their homes.</p><p class="a">The Hon Nick Smith can be rightly proud of his role in achieving the highest number of houses being built in this country, and the passage of this bill through the House is essential to supporting more new houses for Kiwi families.

Thank you for this opportunity. I rise in the second reading of the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill. Just for a brief moment there, Mr Seymour surprised me, and I think it goes back to his days at the TDC Sawmills in Whangarei, where he actually saw the benefit of working alongside a union to make sure that he got the contract he deserved while he was working there. So when you are ready, brother, come—</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>David Seymour</strong>: I seek leave to make a personal explanation.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: What is the personal explanation about?</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>David Seymour</strong>: No one at that sawmill was unionised.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: No. No, I will not accept that.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>PEENI HENARE</strong>: Thank you very much. Look, I heard the Minister this evening talk about the Acts that have happened in his generation. What that spoke to, to me, was the inability of this Government to actually look into the future for future generations. I consider the Millennials. I am one of the younger members of this House, and I think sadly about my generation, who, it is well known, struggle to get into the housing market.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>David Seymour</strong>: Can we just talk about the bill?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>PEENI HENARE</strong>: Mr Seymour, I would love to talk to the detail of this bill, but, having rushed through this process, I am sad to say that there is just a sheer lack of consultation, a sheer lack of strong review, to allow us to debate this properly. We have always pushed for this to go through the right process. Let us look at other occasions where we failed to go through the right process. I think about a place in Tāmaki-makau-rau. People today call it Ihumātao; its original name is Te Ihu o Mataoho. A failed process led to a long protest from the people of Ihumātao. A failed process meant that under the guise of social housing, under the guise of needing to build more homes, people had their rights transgressed—people had their rights taken away from them. The people of Ihumātao suffered from this Government's poor process, and here we are again, going through this particular bill, rushing it through the House, not allowing the democratic process for iwi, for Māori housing providers, and for the homeless to have their say on this particular bill.</p><p class="a">I recently asked the Minister of Finance written questions about what kind of consultation this Government had undertaken when it decided to sell off the State housing stock. "What Urban Māori authorities, if any, has the Minister consulted with in regards to the sale of Housing New Zealand properties under the Housing Amendment Act 2016?" Answer: "None,". "What Urban Māori authorities, if any, have expressed an interest in purchasing Housing New Zealand properties under the Housing Amendment Act 2016?" Answer: "None." "How many Housing New Zealand properties have been sold to iwi under the Housing Amendment Act 216, if any?" Answer: "None,".</p><p class="CentredEndingItalics"><em>Sitting suspended from 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</em></p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>PEENI HENARE</strong>: Tēnā koe, Mr Assistant Speaker. Thank you once again for this opportunity. Before the dinner break and the excellent chicken curry, I was making reference to the faults around process. I talked about the State housing sell-off and the engagement with iwi and Māori housing providers, and how the answer to all of the questions I posed was "None"—no consultation, no sales to those people.</p><p class="a">To Part 2—and I want to pick up the point that Mr Seymour made. Actually, with regard to the Treaty of Waitangi and the right of first refusal, those who have already settled, Ngāti Whātua ki Ōrākei and Te Kawerau ā Maki—theirs are just two of the Acts of recent times that come to mind, where their rights will be protected under their right of first refusal. This House has already mentioned how that particular process was also fumbled by this Government. We know that Ngāti Whātua were refused the right of first refusal. They took that to court, challenged that decision, and the court found in their favour. Now their rights are protected, and good on them.</p><p class="a">But I want to pick up the point Mr Seymour made about those who do not belong to those iwi collectives, those property owners who were there many years ago when their land was acquired under the Public Works Act. Where are their rights? Where are their rights? As much as I have advocated for the rights under the Treaty of Waitangi and the Treaty settlement process that takes place in this House, it is important to remember in this conversation that the housing crisis affects everybody, so it is important that we look after their rights too.</p><p class="a">Just in conclusion, I stand here on behalf of the Labour Party, and, of course, we look forward to the next stage of this bill. Kia ora.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 19:32:15" ></a><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: I call Meka Whaitiri—5 minutes.</p></div></body>

I am pleased to take a call on the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill. When I got word from our whips that we were having urgency, I was quite excited. I thought I would come down and hear that this Government is finally listening to the cries of Labour and many of the people we represent and introducing a bill that addresses KiwiBuild, for example; building a 100,000 affordable homes. I thought: "Jeez, I will be coming down and standing up in support of that, or a bill that would eliminate speculation in our housing market, maybe"—that would have been a good idea—"or what about extending the brightline test for another 5 years so we can take the pressure out of the housing market?". I thought I was coming to the Chamber to stand up and support that. But, alas, when I came to the Chamber and read the bill, I thought: "This is unfortunate." Generally, when we get to the second reading of a bill, we have had the privilege of taking the bill to a select committee. There are areas of this particular bill—and others have covered them; we have got two areas—where it would have been advantageous to the Government to hear from people who are most affected by this bill. This Government, the Minister himself, has denied those very people the opportunity to present, and there could have been an improvement on the bill, like many submitters actually do. But we will never know, because we are hearing this bill under urgency. </p><p class="a">So when I look at the information we have got in front of us, I want to reference my contribution to Minister's Nick Smith's own Q and A on the Beehive website. Under "Housing Legislation Amendment Bill—Q and A September 2016", a question he answers is: "Why has the Act been extended by three years?". Of course we want to ensure there is transition coverage for those who have started the process, but I thought that if you were going to extend it, you would actually take the time to understand the extent of the problem that we are trying to fix. Under the Minister's own question: "What happens to SHAs that have not lodged consents for qualifying developments before 16 September 2016?", it says that those that have been gazetted before 16 September 2015 and have yet to get consents will be disestablished. Those that have been lodged after 16 September 2015 have 12 months to lodge. </p><p class="a">That sounds all very good, but when you get down to the end of the Minister's answer, it says this: "I have discretion to extend this time limit for new SHAs if I believe best endeavours have been made…". That for me undermines the decision that councils have around giving those consents. Then I looked at: "Will other Housing Accords be established?". Of course, I am a proud member of Ikaroa-Rāwhiti and we have housing issues that are real in the regions. That was the other reason why I got excited about this bill. I thought: "Finally—finally—this Government was going to deal with the issues in the regions where we are struggling to house our people." By way of example, 377 homes in the Hawke's Bay have been flogged off—377. How many have been built since National has been in Government? Seven—seven homes. There is an absolute need in our regions, and when I look at this bill, it does not even address the opportunities that are real in the regions. I wanted to come to this House to fly the regional flag, because this Government seems to forget about our regions. </p><p class="a">Finally, in the minute that I have left, I want to make a short contribution about Part 2 of this bill. I support the calls from this side of the Chamber that it is too important not to go to select committee. There is only a very short explanation from the Minister's very own question and answer around why we need to change the Housing Act. I have read the clauses in the bill. It talks about the fact that existing Treaty settlements will be protected, but what about the future ones? I listen intently to all members on that side of the Chamber to hear how we are going to safeguard future Treaty settlements under this piece of legislation. So that is why I stand in support of Labour on this particular bill. It goes well short of addressing the housing shortages we have throughout this country, and if the Government was listening, it would separate the bill and we could address it appropriately. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

The previous speaker, Meka Whaitiri, mentioned that the Government does not have any plan, but I would like to clarify that this Government has a comprehensive plan to address the issue of housing supply and affordability, and the issues associated with our strong, growing economy. It is very important, we need to understand, that this economy is growing, and more and more houses are required because people are staying here.</p><p class="a">It is important to understand that we have to free up the land so that the builders can build the houses that are much in need. With this bill, we will be able to free up more land and help builders to build a house. It is important legislation, and we are looking forward to this vote from all sides of the House, but unfortunately the Opposition is not at all happy to support such legislation. Opposition members keep complaining about it, but they do not want to support the Government when it is taking steps to address it. Thank you.</p></div></body>

I want to address one of the major concerns that we have on this side of the House with not only this bill but the whole special housing areas policy, and that is the very weak affordability requirements that are at the heart of this policy.</p><p class="a">I want to address my comments to a couple of Supplementary Order Papers that are on the Table. The first is in the name of Metiria Turei and the second is in my name, and both of them make a proposal about how affordability requirements could be better incorporated into the housing accords and special housing areas legislation. But I think it is important to understand the context of this, and the context is a debate that we have been having in this Parliament for some time, really, about the best way to deliver affordability.</p><p class="a">The Minister's view, if I may characterise it—and I invite him to take a call on this and put me straight, if he wants to—is that the only real way to deliver sustained improvements in affordability is by increasing the supply of dwellings in the market, and in an innocent, fifth-form economics textbook kind of way, he rejects the idea that actually building homes that are affordable might help. He considers that to be, I think, an unnecessary distraction and, really, the focus should be on increasing supply. There is an irony that members will have noticed, which is that a Minister who places such great store on increasing the supply of houses has so signally failed to do that during his time as housing Minister, but what we have seen as the accords and special housing areas have been rolled out is that with the first one, the accord with Auckland Council, there was quite a lot of debate about whether there should be, in fact, the ability of the council to require that special housing areas should have to deliver a percentage of affordable housing.</p><p class="a">There was some pressure on the Minister, I think, from within the Parliament and some pressure from Auckland Council, and at the last minute he conceded—I think it was possibly in the Committee stage or at the select committee—that, yes, the Auckland Council, under that accord, would have the ability to require that 10 percent of homes in special housing areas be affordable. We have always taken the view that that is extremely modest—in fact, far too modest—because the market, on its own, is delivering about 5 percent of new dwellings in the so-called affordable range. Students of history will know that only 30 to 35 years ago, actually, the market was delivering about a third of all new dwellings in the affordable range, and that is one of the really crucial indicators of how badly out of whack the housing market has become, because so few houses are affordable—about 5 percent. So, anyway, that was the situation with Auckland Council.</p><p class="a">In some of the other accords—and I am thinking particularly of Tauranga—the mayor and council officials directly asked the Minister to insert affordability quotas into their accord so they could require that a certain number of homes in their special housing areas be affordable. The Minister point-blank refused. He and his officials said: "We're not interested in that. We're only interested in increasing the supply of homes. We're not interested in requiring developers to provide a share of new dwellings that are affordable."</p><p class="a">What we know—and this completely kind of busts out of the fifth-form economics textbook from which the Minister's thinking is derived—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Clare Curran</strong>: Year 10.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>PHIL TWYFORD</strong>: —year 10; thank you—is that in an overheated, undersupplied market, developers will always choose to build more expensive dwellings because that is where they make bigger profit margins, and that is the story of Auckland in the last 10 years. If you look at the apartments that are being built in Auckland at the moment, 99 percent of them are at the luxury end of the market. Very, very few of them are affordable. If the market was in perfect balance, and if it was a perfectly functioning market, yes, the market would—</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 19:45:31" ></a><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH (Minister for Building and Housing)</strong>: I am happy to engage. I note that this is a bill that is going through all stages, and so I do want to be able to engage in a proper debate about the issues.</p><p class="a">The first thing I want to challenge Mr Twyford on is that in his opening comments he said that I had been singularly unsuccessful in growing residential investment in New Zealand. Well, let me actually give the numbers from Statistics New Zealand. In my first year, 2013, the growth in residential investment was 27 percent. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: It's not all about you, Nick.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: Well, no, I am simply saying what the record is. It is actually about building houses. I am just simply saying, let us look at the actual record: 27 percent growth in 2012; 27 percent growth in residential investment in 2013; and another 29 percent growth in 2015 and 2016. That is the longest—[<em>Interruption</em>] Well, I have a simple question for members opposite: cite me 4 years when there has been faster growth in residential investment. Tell me the years in which there has been stronger growth in residential construction than in the official statistics from 2013 to 2016.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tracey Martin</strong>: We ask the questions; you answer them.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: Oh! I am making the point that you do not know the answer. So we know now that that is incorrect, and members should stop making that assertion.</p><p class="a">The second thing is the question of how you get affordable houses built. So let us look across New Zealand. Where are the most new homes that are being built in an affordable range? Answer: Christchurch. Actually, if you look at the figures from Statistics New Zealand, you have over 4,500 homes built in Christchurch—brand new homes built—under $500,000. Is there affordability regulation in Christchurch? No, there is not—no, there is not. I say to Mr Twyford, the Productivity Commission—not the Government, but the Productivity Commission—concluded it did not work. The independent hearings panel in Auckland concluded it did not work. Actually, the Auckland Council concluded it does not work.</p><p class="a">So I simply challenge the member and say there is no evidence that shows that regulating house prices is the way in which we improve the affordability and supply. The best means is to increase supply. That is what this bill does. Let us be very clear in this Committee that this bill will enable Auckland to have 8,000 homes sooner—8,000 homes sooner—and it is a litmus test for parties in this Parliament as to whether they are part of the problem or part of the solution in terms of growing housing supply in New Zealand.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 19:49:04" ></a><strong>PHIL TWYFORD (Labour—Te Atatū)</strong>: Before I was so rudely interrupted, I was saying that I think this is a debate worth having, because there is clearly a difference between, certainly, our side and the National Government benches on this question. The Minister for Building and Housing referenced the Productivity Commission, he referenced the experience in Christchurch, but, curiously, he did not reference the situation in Auckland, where not only are we falling dismally behind in supply and the deficit has accumulated, the 42,000 dwellings that the independent hearings panel estimates has built up on the Minister's watch not only has supply been such a signal failure but also affordability has been a disaster. We can see that today with the average dwelling in Auckland—not just old Auckland City, but across the entire amalgamated city and the Auckland region—now costing $1 million.</p><p class="a">It is an absolute disaster. There is no affordability. We desperately need more affordable housing, and I suspect that the Minister is among the kind of dewy-eyed optimists who think the unitary plan, by injecting some greenfield land into the system and upzoning to allow more density in the city, is automatically going to deliver big gains in affordability. There is a lot of smart money and a lot of urban land economists and others who are highly sceptical about that contention and do not believe that on its own it is likely to go anywhere near what is needed in terms of increasing the volume of supply. That is why—because urban land markets are so imperfect and because, for example, there are demand pressures in the real estate market—under this Government's policy, settings are unchecked, and there are vast amounts of foreign money flooding into the real estate market. There is a whole system of tax policy and incentives that encourage the investment of massive amounts of capital in real estate speculation under this Government.</p><p class="a">So because those things are all in place, because we have this massive accumulated deficit in the number of dwellings that are needed, and we will have for a long time to come—in fact, the Minister's own officials say that the deficit of dwellings in Auckland will not be eliminated before 2030. That is the advice of Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment officials released to Labour under the Official Information Act. The Minister denies it—I know he does not want to hear, because it is bad news for him—but that is the fact, and that is why Labour believes that measures like inclusionary zoning and being able to require a percentage of affordable dwellings is the sensible thing to do. If we care about affordability, if we care about making homeownership and, in fact, renting affordable, we need to be willing to intervene in the market to market to make that happen. We cannot wait until some great nirvana, decades into the future, when we have a perfectly functioning urban land market. That is certainly not going to happen on this Minister's watch. People cannot afford to wait.</p><p class="a">We need affordable housing, and that is why I think Metiria Turei has, very sensibly, put up Supplementary Order Paper 210, which would require a prescribed percentage of affordable dwellings and "must include a percentage of dwellings to be available for sale at a price equal to or below the price that is 4 times the median household income in that area." Four times the median household income—I think the Minister would probably agree with that. He would agree that that is a worthy goal. His eyes are going from side to side—I am not quite sure how to interpret that—but I think, based on the Minister's previous comments, he would agree that four times the median household income is a good thing. That is why my amendment that is on the Table would require that all future special housing areas—and it would be prospective, not retrospective—that would be enacted under the 3-year extension in this bill would be required to have a percentage of affordable dwellings.</p><p class="a">The Minister agreed to that. He agreed to the principle of exclusionary zoning—that is, a quota of affordable dwellings. He agreed to that in the sweetheart deal that he negotiated with Auckland iwi in the wake of his vacant Crown land fiasco. If it is good enough to put a quota of affordable homes—</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 19:54:05" ></a><strong>DAVID SEYMOUR (Leader—ACT)</strong>: Can I start by correcting the member who has just resumed his seat, Phil Twyford. The policy of having a certain quota of houses for sale in a new development below a certain price level is not exclusionary zoning; it is called inclusionary zoning. Let us just talk a little bit about what that policy is and why it does not work.</p><p class="a">The best summary of inclusionary zoning is that it is a narrow tax designed to achieve a broader public policy purpose. Let me just expand a bit on that, particularly for the benefit of Grant Robertson, who is already shaking his head with confusion, something that he has been quite used to doing throughout his life. If the Government is to make a rule that a certain proportion of dwellings within a development have to be sold at a given price, that rule will only be binding—i.e., it will only have an effect—if the price level that is set is lower than the price that the developer would have otherwise sold that particular dwelling for. The only effect of that could be that the developer loses revenue on their overall development in order to achieve compliance with the law, even though they do not necessarily achieve any wider public policy purpose.</p><p class="a">What we are talking about is, effectively, the same as imposing a tax on a particular developer in order to achieve the wider public policy purpose of making housing available for people in all price brackets. So then you might ask the next question: what will be the effect of imposing that narrow tax on developers, the very people whom we wish to bring housing into existence in order to solve the shortage of housing? Well, we often discuss in this House the effect of taxes on behaviour, and we often hear from the other side of the House that we should have higher taxes on bad things such as tobacco because when taxes are higher, less of the behaviour that is taxed will take place.</p><p class="a">On this side of the House, where we respect savings, investment, and hard work, we often lament that high taxes discourage those activities. But if we follow the consistency of principle that both sides of the House sign up to at different times, then having a tax on developers could only lead to—wait for it—less development. This is how stupid the policy of inclusionary zoning is. It deliberately imposes a discouragement—a tax—on the very people society needs to bring forth housing development in an effort to bring forward more housing development for the people who need it most.</p><p class="a">Only Metiria Turei, who has just told me that she did not pay attention in fifth-form economics, could bring a Supplementary Order Paper to the Committee tonight that will have precisely the opposite effect of the intention that she purports it to have. And, as I have said in this Chamber—it seems like too many times in the short time I have been here—it is not good enough to make public policy with good intentions. Sometimes the softness of the hearts of the people making these proposals extends that softness all the way up to their heads. We need to properly analyse the outcomes and effects of public policies rather than purely their intentions, and the intention of inclusionary zoning will not be matched by its outcomes. Therefore, I cannot support Supplementary Order Paper 210, which Metiria Turei has put forward.</p><p class="a">I will just shuffle through and see whether there are any others from Metiria Turei that I might not support. Actually, we might leave that for another call, but I hope it is very clear why I will not be supporting the Supplementary Order Papers relating to inclusionary zoning, and neither should any member in this Committee who has the best interests of New Zealanders at heart. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 19:58:44" ></a><strong>METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green)</strong>: Funny story, actually: I applied at my high school to do economics and they put me in the home economics class because I am a girl. So there you go. There you go, Mr Seymour. And yes, if you had known me in fifth form, you would have had a really fun time.</p><p class="a">Anyway, I do just want to deal with Mr Seymour's criticism and what he is saying of Supplementary Order Paper 210, which I have on the Table to require that the special housing areas (SHAs) have a proportion of building that is sold at a price that is either at or below four times the median house hold income, which is the median multiple that is used internationally as a general definition of affordability.</p><p class="a">The reason why I think that is justifiable to require in SHAs is that those who get access to an SHA get fast-tracked consenting processes. They actually save money—significant amounts of money—and time in the process of developing that land. It is good that they are developing that land for housing, if it is required—because, remember, there is no obligation for them to build once they get access to the benefit of the fast-tracked consenting process. This Government will not require them to build. In fact, even under this new bill they are required only to make an application for a resource consent; it does not require them to get a code of compliance, which is indicative of their having built a property. So these speculators, these investors, and these developers have access to an enormous financial advantage by having their land declared as a special housing area, with no obligation to build but with fast-tracked access through the resource consent process.</p><p class="a">What is their reciprocal obligation to the community, whose efforts—through us, as representatives in Parliament—time, and money are delivered to them for free? These developers get access to the special housing areas and the fast-tracked consents. It is a public interest that is delivered to them for free. What is their reciprocal obligation?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: They build houses.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>METIRIA TUREI</strong>: What is their reciprocal obligation back to the public? The Minister says "houses", but he is talking about houses that cost $600,000 - plus to buy. That is not in the public interest. It is delivered by the whole of the country for developers to be able to get fast-tracked access through the consent process, save money—considerable amounts of money—in the process, and still, at market rates, sell off those properties. That is not providing a reciprocal responsibility back to the public, who have provided to those developers some access to services and support that costs money and that the developers do not have to pay for.</p><p class="a">We want to make sure that if there is going to be a gift from the public to these developers, there is a reciprocal obligation for them to provide a public benefit. One of the public benefits that has to be provided as part of any housing development process that is driven by the Government on behalf of the country as a whole is that affordable housing is built and provided. That is the whole point of the special housing areas—that affordable housing is built and provided for sale.</p><p class="a">There is no requirement in the special housing areas policy, as it is or under this bill, for genuinely affordable housing to be provided by those developers. The Green Party says that that is part of the deal. You, the developer, get access to this special, fast-tracked process. You get to save money as you do it. You get to make money from quite a big proportion of the properties you build and sell, but you have a reciprocal obligation back to the New Zealand public, who have given you that opportunity.</p><p class="a">Why is it so difficult for the Government to understand that reciprocal obligation? It should also be understandable by the ACT member. I know he has got a philosophy that he lives by in ACT, and it is great that ACT has got one of those—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Members</strong>: Ha, ha!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>METIRIA TUREI</strong>: —I did mean that nicely; it came out kind of not quite—but even in that sense, he should be able to understand that if there is a genuine balance or equitable relationship between two parties to a deal, then both parties need to benefit from that deal in a genuine way. That is part of the philosophy.</p><p class="a">At the moment, all of the benefit rests with the developer of the special housing areas. We know that because most of the special housing areas in Auckland have not had any building on them yet. That is because land banking those special housing areas and getting the consents fast-tracked, but not building, provides those developers with a financial windfall that is delivered to them by the public.</p><p class="a">So let us just find a way—a gentle way. It is not going to scare anybody massively. It is not going to make a huge financial imposition on those developers. It is not going to stop further SHAs from continuing. If this Supplementary Order Paper passes, it simply provides a mechanism for making sure that there is some reciprocity in this deal. That is at least the minimum that we should be requiring, as members of Parliament representing constituents who are locked out of the housing market and who are telling us every day that there is a housing crisis and that they cannot afford to buy houses when they need them. This is at least some way that we can make sure their interests are better represented. It is not complicated. It is a small amendment to the existing legislation. It makes it clear what the affordability target is, which the Minister himself has agreed is a good target: four times the median household income. He has publicly said that he understands that to be the right target.</p><p class="a">Let us make sure that when we, as a Parliament, are doing deals to improve housing in New Zealand and to increase the supply of housing in New Zealand—as we know needs to happen—there is a clear target for what affordability means. This is so that everybody who is involved in the deals around building homes knows what they are getting into, with full disclosure about what is expected by the Government in engaging in this deal, and so that it is financially responsible—because, of course, this is not a huge imposition on those developers. It gives them an opportunity to look more comprehensively at their overall building package—how many homes they are going to build and sell for significantly more, and there will be some people in the market who can afford to buy those homes at quite an inflated price—and to make sure that they will be able to make a significant profit and keep on developing. This is not going to provide any chilling effect on these developers; it just slightly changes their price points and how they manage the properties they have got.</p><p class="a">It is absolutely essential that we get more affordable housing, and the only way to do that is to be clear about what affordability is—which is three to four times the median household income—and to make sure that those who are getting a public benefit from this legislation have an obligation back to the public to build those houses.</p><p class="a">More than 80 percent of Aucklanders have said that there is a housing crisis. Well over 50 percent—in some cases 60 percent—of New Zealanders say that house prices need to fall, including homeowners and including Aucklanders. We know that it is a crisis and it needs to be dealt with. This is a small change that could be made to fix at least some of the problems we have with SHAs that are not delivering. It is not expensive. It is not complicated. It is just sensible and it respects the public benefit that these developers are getting. Thank you.</p></div></body>

I guess my real concern is how did the Minister allow it to get to this point? So, 10 days out from this particular part expiring, here we are in urgency actually having a debate about this and trying to push it through quickly. Obviously we have had 3 years to think about this, and we have had 3 years to see whether the short-term measure was going to be effective. I mean, when we look at the regulatory impact statement, it does say that it was supposed to be a short-term measure to streamline and fast track housing development and associated infrastructure through the Resource Management Act. Well, we have known for a lot longer than the last week that that short-term measure was not going to be enough and it was going to need to be extended. So I really want to know from the Minister what was the delay? What was the delay in making the decision to bring this to the House to extend this?</p><p class="a">There are problems that have been highlighted in the regulatory impact statement in relation to this, problems with regard to what had been hoped to be achieved that has not been achieved, and it is spelt out really clearly here. It does say that "The principal issue discussed in this RIS is whether to amend HASHAA [to extend the] timeframe to allow further SHAs to be established, and to create new provisions in the HASHAA for a 12-month time limit to lodge consents within SHAs, and ministerial discretion to extend this time limit." It basically says that there are still consents waiting that need to be put through. The Minister must have already known that they were not going to be completed by 16 September 2016, so why the delay?</p><p class="a">I also want to point out that it is not something that has recently come to light. For the last few months at least there has been an ongoing discussion about this. I just want to refer to an article in the newspaper—[<em>Interruption</em>] Thank you. I want to refer to an article in the newspaper where one of our mayoral candidates, Phil Goff—who we think has a strong likelihood of winning the mayoralty—pointed out that this transition was going to be a problem. He expressed his concerns that the Minister had done nothing to deal with this transition. The actual headline is "Legal stuff up could hamper plans to build 15,000 new homes in special housing areas". He highlighted that on 25 May, and at that time Mr Nick Smith is reported in this article as saying that the Government was: "open-minded about legislation to effectively extend the special housing area legislation but would not make a decision until it had seen the plan recommended by the hearings panel and the council's response."</p><p class="a">So I would like to know from Minister Nick Smith whether or not that is what delayed him. Did he see the plan just yesterday, or last week, hence why he has had to bring this to the House only 10 days out from when it was due to expire, and why we could not give it the public scrutiny and the due process that it deserved—is that why we have delayed to this extent? I just want to know, really, what other special housing area projects are on the cards that the Government had anticipated would get through by the 16 September date that have not actually made it to that mark, so that we are fully aware of the reasons why we do need to extend this for 3 years.</p><p class="a">I guess we do accept that, despite the fact that what the Government has done here has been underwhelming and has not achieved anywhere near the extent of what we needed it to achieve in terms of actually addressing the housing crisis, it has done something, even if it is just a little bit. For that reason, we want to support that part of the bill. The second part—obviously we will not go into it now, but we do not support it at all.</p><p class="a">So I just want to know from Mr Smith what the delay has been and why we are here, 10 days out from when this expires. Why are we here under urgency? Why was this not brought to the House sooner? Why could we not have had a more robust, formal discussion about this?</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 20:13:05" ></a><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH (Minister for Building and Housing)</strong>: I do want to give a fair answer to the challenge that Carmel Sepuloni has given around the timing of the bill, and I want to take you through the process and the reason for that timing. The eight developments that are at risk and that this bill addresses arise because of two specific factors. The first is that the council and the Auckland Unitary Plan Independent Hearings Panel have chosen not to zone them residential. If it was a special housing area and the independent hearings panel and the council decided that they were to be zoned residential, there is no issue—no issue on 15 September. It is a special housing area up to 15 September, and on 16 September it is zoned residential under the Auckland Unitary Plan—no problem. The first thing is that we could not know where it was a problem and where it was not a problem until that process was completed on 19 August. </p><p class="a">The second issue is that in each of those special housing areas, there is a legal process for the plan change, and that process for the plan change is before independent commissioners. So if you look through each of those eight special housing areas, they are being heard by independent commissioners, whom neither the council nor myself is lawfully allowed to ring up and say: "Hurry it up, come on and make a decision before that deadline of 15 September." There are some special housing areas that, back in April, I was worried would not be through the process but actually are, and are not a concern. </p><p class="a">Here is the further point: I think the Parliament would agree that we want these special housing areas progressed into houses as quickly as possible. The more pressure that we can put on those landowners and those councils to get on and get the plan changes and the resource consents and the houses built, I think the better off we are. If, for instance, I had come to this Parliament in April and provided a generic "get out of jail free" card and said: "Don't worry about the 15 September date, because I'm going to extend that date.", it would have had exactly the opposite effect that the Parliament would want, and that is maximum pressure on both the council and on the landowners to be able to do that transition. </p><p class="a">So it is for those good reasons—we did not know where the unitary plan had completed, we did not know, in each of these areas, where they were going to be finished, and we wanted people working as fast as possible to bring those special housing areas into homes—that the timing of this bill is such that it has been brought before the House today.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 20:16:06" ></a><strong>IAIN LEES-GALLOWAY (Labour—Palmerston North)</strong>: My question for the Minister for Building and Housing is: why is it that he is opposing Metiria Turei's amendment to add new clause 4A as set out in Supplementary Order Paper 210? I assume he is opposing it, because I heard some of his interjections that it would not work, or words to that effect.</p><p class="a">The only contribution we have had from the Government side on Metiria Turei's Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) is from David Seymour, who seemed to take the view that having affordable housing, requiring developers to build affordable housing, was somehow a tax on developers and that it would stifle development of these special housing areas. He expressed that as the Government's view—that there should be no room for putting requirements in place that affordable housing should be built on special housing areas.</p><p class="a">I want to explore that a little bit, because if we look at Metiria Turei's actual Supplementary Order Paper, it is to amend section 14(1)(d). Section 14(1)(d) in the principal legislation says that "a 'qualifying development' in a special housing area is a development— … (d) that will contain not less than the prescribed percentage (if any) of affordable dwellings." So the legislation as it stands actually already allows for affordable homes to be prescribed in a special housing area. What does "prescribed" mean? Well, section 14(3) says that the word "'prescribed',—(a) in subsection (1)(b) and (c), means prescribed for qualifying developments in special housing areas by an Order in Council made under section 15(1) …". Section 15(1) lists the criteria that the Governor-General may, by Order in Council, include in the criteria for a special housing area. Section 15(4) says: "The affordability criteria that may be specified are not limited by section 9(3)(a) but may include, without limitation, criteria defined by reference to median house prices, median household income, individual income, the median multiple (as referred to in section 9(3)(a)(ii)) or any other matter relevant to affordability as it applies to the district in which the special housing area falls,".</p><p class="a">So the legislation actually already takes a small step towards doing what Metiria Turei's Supplementary Order Paper would require. The difference is, of course, that it enables affordable housing to be a requirement in a special housing area. Metiria Turei's Supplementary Order Paper would require affordable housing to be built in special housing areas, and has a definition of what affordable housing is. If that is so evil, if that is going to stop developers building in special housing areas, then why was it included in the original legislation? If it was included in the original legislation, what does the Government have against (a) making it a requirement, and (b) setting some definition of what affordable housing is?</p><p class="a">If the Government and the Minister disagree with the definition, which is that it should be no more than four times the median household income in that area, then what is the Government's definition of affordable? What does the Government actually believe is an affordable home? What is the point of setting aside special housing areas if not to make housing more affordable? If the point is to make housing more affordable, then what is the Government's definition? If it is not the definition that Metiria Turei has offered, then what is it? We have not heard that from Government members. We have not heard that from the Minister.</p><p class="a">So I would appreciate answers to all of those questions. Why not make it a requirement? Why is having affordable housing so much of an issue if it was already included in the principal legislation? Why not have a definition? What is the definition? So there are four questions there, and I would very much appreciate an answer from the Minister to those questions, because it would certainly enlighten me as to the Government's position on Metiria Turei's SOP.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 20:21:07" ></a><strong>KRIS FAAFOI (Labour—Mana)</strong>: It is a pleasure to take a call on Part 1 in this debate on the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill. I want to continue along the theme that a number of my colleagues have spoken on, around affordability. I do want to point to paragraph 10 of the regulatory impact statement, which is on Part 1, which says that three-quarters of the special housing areas require around 10 percent of homes within the development to be affordable. Either way you look at it, special housing areas are a form of market intervention, and therefore I do not think our friend Mr Seymour would agree with those.</p><p class="a">I think we really have to question the effectiveness of special housing areas. I do pay respect to my brothers and sisters from Auckland, but there is an issue emerging in Wellington, too. I do not have a special housing area within my electorate. I know that the Government has an agreement with Wellington City Council that does not cover my area, but when you look at the market as it operates in a raw sense in Porirua, you can see the market at the very top end working quite well, if you are a developer. There are plenty of houses in some new developments in Porirua that are around the $750,000 to $1 million mark. [<em>Interruption</em>] Yes, that is right. If you are in that area of the market, construction is going well—that end of the market is booming.</p><p class="a">But if you are at the affordable end of the market—and you can look at defining that however you like, and I do acknowledge Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) 210 from Metiria Turei—there is nothing available for you. In theory you could claim that the special housing areas would be able to come in and make a difference, but as we have seen in Auckland that is not the case, and we seriously question whether or not the affordability percentages around the special housing areas are having any effect in Auckland and, if they were to come further south, what they would do to a market such as Porirua.</p><p class="a">At the moment in this region we have got around 460 empty State homes. In my particular area of Porirua there are 126 empty State homes, along with large swathes of land that used to have State homes on them that the Government demolished. It promised to return some homes to those areas, and has not done a single thing.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>David Seymour</strong>: Halfway, mate.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>KRIS FAAFOI</strong>: Mr Seymour has got something to say about that; I do not think it would be helpful. So we have got a market in Auckland that is not working, and a market in other areas of the country that is not working. Although we support the extension of the special housing areas, I think we have to take a good, hard look at the effectiveness of these special housing areas and look at just whether or not they are working and whether we have got a large enough percentage of those affordable homes being built for Kiwis.</p><p class="a">I do remember at the beginning of the process of the Aotea block being built that there was a proposal that a certain percentage—larger than 10 percent—had to be deemed affordable. That did not happen. What you have got now is that people who have got plenty of money are fine in the Porirua market, but people who have got no money are struggling to get into the property market to buy a house or even find a house to rent in the private market, and there is almost nothing available in the Housing New Zealand sphere. Of the 42 houses that are available in Porirua at the moment, I cannot see why those houses are not being given to families that are on the waiting list. I believe the waiting list as it stands, which was cut down about 2 or 3 years ago, is about 60 families. So we have got empty homes in Porirua and 50 or so families that desperately need them.</p><p class="a">I think the extension of the special housing areas might be something that the Government is trying to do to make more affordable homes available, but it is certainly not meeting the demand from those people who want affordable homes. I would suggest that this Committee looks really closely at SOP 210 from Metiria Turei, which defines affordability. Mr Seymour does not like it because it is a market intervention. But if you look at it, if you look at how the market is operating now, it is not working for all New Zealanders. It might work for Mr Seymour and his friends.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: It's not working for him.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>KRIS FAAFOI</strong>: It may not be, but it is certainly not working for all New Zealanders. So we have got some serious concerns about Part 1 of the bill and the effectiveness of the special housing areas. We have got even more concerns about Part 2, but we will come to them when the time comes.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 20:26:01" ></a><strong>DAVID SEYMOUR (Leader—ACT)</strong>: I believe I may be able to assist with some of the points raised. I do not know whether I will be able to make it simple enough for a King's College old boy, but I am certainly going to try my damnedest.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Iain Lees-Galloway</strong>: Jealousy will get you nowhere.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>DAVID SEYMOUR</strong>: Jealous of what? The issue at hand comes down to a clash between two similar but really quite different concepts. One is affordable housing, and the other is housing affordability. On the one hand, when you talk about affordable housing you talk about a certain number of homes being available at a price for a segment of the market. Many of the interventions that are proposed by the political left are what I would refer to as affordable housing initiatives. Let us have inclusionary zoning to try to section off a part of the market at a certain price. Let us have the Government, or some Government-related entity, develop housing, because it will somehow have different means and motives from the private sector.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Denis O'Rourke</strong>: Exactly. What's wrong with that?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>DAVID SEYMOUR</strong>: Let us have some sort of subsidy for people to be able to afford housing. Denis O'Rourke—not much gets past Denis O'Rourke. I told the Committee that I was describing the policies of the political left, and Denis O'Rourke has correctly surmised that I am describing his policies. Not much gets past Denis O'Rourke. </p><p class="a">The problem with the affordable housing agenda, as opposed to housing affordability, is that you cannot have affordable housing without housing affordability. The reason housing becomes unaffordable in the first place is that there is a shortage of housing supplied to the market, and when that happens, inevitably there is going to be a bidding war, which those with the least income are going to lose. Until housing becomes affordable you are not going to achieve housing affordability. </p><p class="a">What will it take to increase the supply of housing supplied to the market, and therefore achieve housing affordability across New Zealand, and therefore make it possible for there to be more housing that is affordable for those with the lowest incomes? It is interesting to hear Metiria Turei referencing the median multiple measure, which is a measure that has been popularised by my good friend Hugh Pavletich from Christchurch, who is one of the co-authors of the Demographia survey. </p><p class="a">I wonder whether Metiria Turei has carefully read those Demographia surveys, and I wonder whether she has spoken to Hugh Pavletich or Wendell Cox. I wonder whether she has discussed with Julie Anne Genter what she has read. What those reports say, in no uncertain terms, is that the reason we have a shortage of affordable housing in New Zealand, as with any other market, is that we have adopted land-use planning laws that constrain the amount of land upon which people are able to build, thereby leading to a shortage of housing, thereby leading to a bidding war that not everybody can win, and those with the least money end up losing and end up with a shortage of housing that they are able to access. </p><p class="a">The economics of it are that simple, and it is very good to hear that Metiria Turei has become a convert to this line of thinking, referencing the Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey—something that those of us on this side of the House have long looked to as a guide for making better housing policy. But if we wish to follow in those footsteps, we need comprehensive reform of New Zealand's land use planning laws. It is not good enough that councils are able to draw a line around a city such as Auckland, such as the metropolitan urban limit, and say: "Thou shalt not build beyond that line." That has created an enormous shortage of land, which has created an enormous shortage of housing, which has left people unable to afford any home whatsoever. </p><p class="a">Finally, we must reform the way that we do infrastructure funding. Presently, the councils cover too many of the costs and central government gets most of the fiscal benefit, and that is why councils are unwilling to build more housing. What this Government really needs to do is reform those underlying fundamentals, not tinker, as Metiria Turei has suggested in her amendment.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 20:31:08" ></a><strong>GRANT ROBERTSON (Labour—Wellington Central)</strong>: I feel like the parent who has to do the thing that they never ever want to do—to sit their child down and say: "I am sorry, there is no Santa." So for David Seymour's benefit, this is the ACT Party equivalent of the difficult parental conversation: the market is broken. It is completely broken. It is not delivering housing to the majority of New Zealanders who want to buy it. It is broken—it is completely broken—so standing up and making semantic arguments about the difference between affordable housing and housing affordability is just perpetuating the purist model that I know David Seymour believes in. I know David Seymour believes in this as an article of faith, but Mr Seymour actually needs to look around and realise that the market is broken. It is not delivering housing affordability; it is not delivering affordable housing.</p><p class="a">Bill English, the Minister of Finance, stood up straight before the Budget and said that in the last 10 years, only 5 percent of new builds have been affordable. He acknowledged it. It was interesting that while Mr Seymour gave his first intervention this evening, Nick Smith was in the chair saying things like "He absolutely is right." and "Hear, hear." when David Seymour said that there was no place for an affordable housing requirement within special housing areas, which seemed a little odd to us on this side of the Chamber because it is already in the Government's law. In fact, they have got a requirement for 10 percent affordability in Auckland now, so it is a little odd for Nick Smith to do that.</p><p class="a">He then followed it up, brilliantly, with another intervention—I think it might have been when Iain Lees-Galloway was talking—saying: "It won't work. It doesn't work." Well, it is in his law. Why is it in his law if it does not work? The point is that it is not working because the whole special housing area process is not working. That is the problem. We have got only 57 of the 154 special housing areas with anything actually happening—even remotely close to happening—on them, so the problem here is that the market is broken and it requires an intervention. That is the problem that David Seymour has.</p><p class="a">It is surprising that the Minister is not prepared to back the Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) in Metiria Turei's name, because he himself has already started the ball rolling here. We need these special housing areas to be delivering a range of housing, because what we want in New Zealand are communities to develop that are not ghettos, that actually do provide opportunities for people to live in cities close to where they work, and that are not only for those who are the very, very wealthy. That is not what New Zealand was built on. If David Seymour has got a big problem with all of this, he needs to go to any public meeting in New Zealand, which are mostly attended by slightly older New Zealanders, and say "Who in this room got their first house through a State Advances Loan?", or "Who got their first house by capitalising the family benefit?". Successive Governments have intervened in the housing market to give New Zealanders a fair go at the Kiwi Dream of owning their own home, and that is what needs to happen here. Here is an opportunity to do that.</p><p class="a">The ultimate way to do this, Mr Seymour, is actually a programme where we really intervene in the market to fix it, which is KiwiBuild—where the Government leads the housing development programme of affordable housing, where we do not just leave it up to the private developers, and where we actually say: "Here is a chance for the Government to show some leadership and develop affordable housing." For the special housing areas, we do not know what the counterfactual is in terms of how many of these areas would have been developed anyway. I know here in Wellington when you look at the list of special housing areas, most of them are ones that were already under way or would have been developed anyway. But we are prepared to give it a go. We are prepared to say: "Yep, let's get in behind the special housing areas and see whether we can make them work a little bit better." But they are not going to work to deliver affordable housing unless we actually commit as a Parliament to making that happen.</p><p class="a">That is what this SOP is about. That is what the Government should be delivering on. It has already got it in the legislation for Auckland, so let us make it possible for everyone around the country.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 20:36:06" ></a><strong>ALFRED NGARO (National)</strong>: I have to say that at the beginning of that speech by Grant Robertson I felt like I was in a bit of a whānau family moment, but happy Father's Day. I know that you were making out that it was like sitting down your son, and you were doing this to David Seymour. I was not sure what was going on there, but obviously you wanted to school him in what you believe your facts say—what your belief is.</p><p class="a">I just wanted to respond to some of the comments. Mr Robertson talked about the capitalising of family benefits. I have to say that my family works for one of those, but if we look at the history of that, it actually was initiated in 1956. I ask the members on the other side whether they remember when it was taken out—1986. Do you remember when that was? [<em>Interruption</em>] OK. It was actually under a Labour Government, with David Lange, and that is when it was removed. So if you are going to use that as a point of difference, just remember to remind yourselves of your history and your heritage—where you actually come from. It was taken away under a Labour Government.</p><p class="a">But the conversation has been around affordability, so we can talk about semantics—and I actually agree with my colleague Mr David Seymour in regard to inclusionary zoning, which is what he talked about. Let us talk about some of the facts, then. The Minister used the example of what was happening down in Christchurch previously. I can remember the wailing and the gnashing of teeth in this House when talking about affordability in Christchurch. We know that rents were high, affordability of housing was in a terrible state, but the intention of this Government, of course, was to ensure that we built to the supply, to meet the demand—these are the facts of what we are talking about.</p><p class="a">The CoreLogic sales data in regard to home loans and price caps for the existing sales—I will go straight through to the facts of this. This was on 31 March 2016: out of the 7,889 homes sold in Christchurch, 5,009 homes—63 percent—were sold for under $500,000. That is right. That is what the number is. In fact, if you go further along, the 5,652 that sold for under $550,000 were 72 percent of the market. That is right. There is the silence of the lambs, because we know we did not regulate the market then and there was no inclusionary zoning. Instead, there was an intention to ensure that we built more to meet the demand. We built more to meet the demand, and you cannot argue with that because those are the facts, that is the reality, and that is what we are doing. The reality is that the special housing accords approach is not the silver bullet. It is one of a range of initiatives that we believe are important to ensure that we meet that demand. We know that is what is important.</p><p class="a">There was some response in regard to consents, and every time we talk about the number of consents that are out there, which this Government is putting through—we think that is important and we use that as a basis. I want to dispel some of that myth. It was surprising to see, firstly, why would those developers want to spend $10,000 for a building consent and not proceed to build? We think that is important. The special housing accords will ensure that there is a time limit to ensure that they apply for a building consent. If you are spending that amount of money, then the intention is that you will do this. But the census data actually proves this. The number of dwellings in the Auckland regional area from 2006 to 2013 under the census data was 33,777. So when we look at the number of consents, 32,419 falls about 10 percent below that. But if we look at the 6-month lag and we bring that up, that is 33,703. I believe that that addresses the issue, which is that the consenting is a good indicator of the fact that not only does it allow them to build but it ensures that they will build. I think that is critically important as well.</p><p class="a">I just want to finish off with the facts and figures again. If we look at the numbers that are there in regard to March 2016, these facts are actually hard to argue with. So for affordability, of 31,963 houses sold in the Auckland region, 30 percent were sold under $600,000—9,638—and 11,840, which is 37 percent, were sold for under $650,000. There is an affordability margin there. Of course we want that to grow, and hence the reason why we are focusing our attention on building more for the demand. Then we believe that what will happen is that we will read out those statistics just like they have been now in Christchurch. Sixty-three percent of the market is affordable. We believe that is important.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 20:41:15" ></a><strong>POTO WILLIAMS (Labour—Christchurch East)</strong>: I just want to perhaps get some assistance. I just want to walk through this a little bit. We are talking about special housing areas, where developers are provided with an opportunity to fast track consents. The notion of fast tracking consents would necessarily mean that you could fast track the building of homes—is that right? Am I correct in assuming that the fast tracking of consents by developers means that you can fast track the homes? That is not a difficult assumption to make.</p><p class="a">So what I would like to know is this. Of these special housing areas—which have been in existence for about 3 years, which is why we are in urgency right now to pass legislation so that they do not expire—how many houses have been put through the process where the developers have got the consents and they have actually built the houses?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Denis O</strong><strong>'</strong><strong>Rourke</strong>: 1,300.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>POTO WILLIAMS</strong>: Wow! That is amazing! How fast is that? So in 3 years, with this fast-track process, we have built 1,300 homes. That is amazing! And do you know what else—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Kris Faafoi</strong>: Slow down!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>POTO WILLIAMS</strong>: Yeah, you are moving too fast! Do you know what else is amazing? What else is amazing is that the Minister the Hon Dr Nick Smith—or whichever way the honorifics go—talks about the affordability issue in Canterbury having been wiped out, because the three-headed housing monster over there has been pulling all these levers in Canterbury. I welcome the National Canterbury MPs getting up and challenging this—that the three-headed housing monster has been pulling all these levers in Canterbury and making houses more affordable. The Minister is saying that the Government has intervened in Canterbury and made it more affordable for housing. Well, I just have to challenge that because actually it was Rūaumoko who did that. Rūaumoko was the one who intervened in the housing market in Canterbury and made it more affordable because we got all this insurance money. We got all this insurance money to rebuild our homes.</p><p class="a">So when the Minister talks about the Government and its special housing areas in Canterbury—well, we had our leader, Andrew Little, down there only a few weeks ago looking at one of those special housing areas, and what was it?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Member</strong>: Bare land?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>POTO WILLIAMS</strong>: It was a vacant lot.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Carmel Sepuloni</strong>: Special.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>POTO WILLIAMS</strong>: It was very special. It was so special that there were ghost houses on it. So when this Government claims that it has intervened in the Canterbury housing market and brought back affordability to the people of Canterbury, I say no, that is rubbish. It was Rūaumoko who did that, and the insurance companies.</p><p class="a">I ask the Canterbury MPs over there on that side of the Chamber to get up and tell me that that is wrong, because that is blatantly not wrong. That is so, so not wrong. When this Government claims affordability in Canterbury, I have to get up and challenge that member on the other side of the Chamber Alfred Ngaro, when he claims all these statistics, which are clearly, clearly not right.</p><p class="a">And who has the oversight of these developers? There is an example; I want to quote from my own electorate, where developers have been given carte blanche to redevelop Housing New Zealand land. They have taken one property out and they have put five, or six, or 10 properties in. Because we have fast tracked this, because we have given developers a whole lot of power under this legislation, who has the oversight of these developers?</p><p class="a">The example I want to quote in my electorate was where a developer was not given any oversight. He built some homes that sat outside of the boundaries of the recession plane, and do you know who discovered that? It was not the council, it was not Government officials, it was the local people who looked at those buildings and said: "Hang on a minute. There's something not right about this. The sun's not getting into my backyard like it used to. This building is clearly, clearly outside of the boundaries of this." So we are expecting developers to actually have oversight of their own developments. In this case, what happened was that building actually had to be taken down because it sat outside of the council consent process. So we have got a cautionary tale right there in Christchurch East—in Christchurch where this Government claims it has intervened and brought affordability back to our housing market, which is clearly not right. So I really challenge this Government to actually live by the affordability.</p></div></body>

The Green Party believes it is a fundamental right for every person in Aotearoa to live in a warm, dry, secure home—or have the opportunity to—a place that a family can count on, whether they own or whether they rent, to be their home as long as they wish to be there, and it should be affordable.</p><p class="a">In the debate this evening there has been a lot of talk about what it is that affordability means—affordable housing, housing affordability, what is the difference? I think it is pretty clear. We do not have to make reference to the median multiple. If people have to spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, that is not affordable. So it is not about just first-home buyers, although that is important too. It is about people having access to a place to call home without having to spend more than 30 percent of their income, so that they have enough for all the other things that every person needs to live a good life in this country. The problem right now is that there are too many people for whom this is not available. They have to spend far more than 30 percent of their income to have a place to call home. As we have been hearing over the last few weeks, during the homelessness inquiry that the Labour Party and the Green Party have been running together, there are too many families, young families, and women, and too many vulnerable people who do not have a place to call home, and that is not right. It is not good for any of us in this country.</p><p class="a">This National Government has been irresponsible. The National Government members cannot blame anyone but themselves when they have been in power for 8 years and house prices are completely out of control. Homelessness is at a record high. They cannot point the finger at anyone but themselves. The reason why we do not have affordable housing is that some people in this country are making a lot of money from buying investment properties. They have got no incentive to rent them out or to do them up. Land prices are increasing so fast that they can just buy a house, hold on to it, and make hundreds of thousands of dollars on which they pay no tax. That is not fair and it is not right, and this irresponsible National Government has done nothing about it because those are the people it represents—the people who are making a lot of money off investment property.</p><p class="a">You know, under the National Government, not only is it not easier to buy a first home but it is a lot easier for those property investors to buy a third or a fourth home. The numbers show this: 5 years ago 36 percent of property investors owned three or more properties. Today it is 51 percent of investors who own three or more properties. So people are able to buy houses, but not everyone has access to an affordable home, and that is not right and not fair.</p><p class="a">There is a whole range of policies that we need to implement to achieve affordable housing in New Zealand. One of them is social housing. It is not rocket science. The Government needs to build more State houses, and everyone in the Opposition has been talking about this. We need to tax all income the same. Capital gains tax—it is fair, and it is only right. Those two things alone are not going to solve the problem.</p><p class="a">Although there is a lot of talk about supply, and supply is an issue in some places like Auckland, the reality is that foreign capital is impacting house prices in cities all across the world, and it is really ridiculous for the National Government not to acknowledge this. Basically, in all of the current account deficit countries, of which New Zealand is one—New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the US, the UK—they have had huge housing bubbles. In the current account surplus countries they have had flat or very slowly rising house prices. This is because a disproportionate amount of the foreign capital we attract is going into real estate, which is not the productive side of the economy that we need it to go to, and it is making housing less accessible for people who live here in New Zealand. It is not just foreign buyers, although that is part of the issue. The reality is a lot of New Zealanders are accessing foreign capital to get mortgages to buy houses, and that bids up housing prices. You can see this in a place like Vancouver, which is very similar to Auckland. Suddenly it has had a big drop in house prices because it put a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 20:51:37" ></a><strong>DAVID SEYMOUR (Leader—ACT)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chair, for this opportunity to address some of the comments made by Grant Robertson, I think, who, sadly, will not be able to hear my comments. Hopefully, he is listening on his crystal set at home. He took it upon himself to tell me that there is no Santa Claus. What a cruel, cruel man is Grant Robertson! But the reality is that there is a Santa Claus. There is a market and, overwhelmingly, it works. If you want to question that, then the first thing you might ask yourself is why it is that the cost of goods that people consume, whether it be cars, whether it be electronics, whether it be clothing, or whether it be food, has gone down relentlessly in real terms, for decades and decades and decades.</p><p class="a">There is one asset that people choose to consume in New Zealand that, strangely enough, has not gone down in real terms, and that is housing. You would have to ask yourself: what is different about the housing market from every other commodity that people like to consume? I will just give you a suggestion that there is no other market that has more intervention by councils and the New Zealand Government than the housing market, because all of those other things I listed are things that can be produced offshore and imported, and that is why we have a competitive market the New Zealand Government cannot touch.</p><p class="a">But what the New Zealand Government is able to touch is the infrastructure and the regulatory environment surrounding land. Those are the things that are regulated by the Government, where there is extensive Government intervention, and, strangely enough, we have found ourselves with a great shortage of that commodity, and at the same time steadily rising prices, which is what has occupied most members and much of the New Zealand public for some time now.</p><p class="a">So here is the world that works: free markets providing many of the things that we consume, with continually dropping prices and increased welfare for citizens. Here is the world that does not work: the world that is regulated and monopolised by Government, and that is access to buildable urban land and the infrastructure to service housing. That is the world that does not work, and that is the world where we have had increasing prices and a shortage of supply. If only members opposite were able to understand these simple distinctions between a free market and a market where the critical inputs are regulated by Government or monopolised in their provision by local councils.</p><p class="a">Of course, if it is a Government failure that has led to our difficulties with housing affordability, then what needs to be done is that the Government needs to change its policy approach to those areas of the market that it dominates. This Committee needs to be debating legislation to seriously reform land-use planning, particularly in urban settings. It is not good enough that our Resource Management Act has grown from 400 pages to 900 pages in the last 25 years. It has simply become more complicated. Only Grant Robertson, only the Labour Party, would believe that an activity governed by 900 pages of legislation—the purpose of which is just to set out the rules for another level of the Government's interventions—was a free market.</p><p class="a">When we do development, we need infrastructure, and the roads and the pipes that make up urban infrastructure are extremely costly to councils, yet the development that councils are in charge of consenting is extremely profitable to central government. We need to renegotiate the deal between central government and local government and actually share revenue to incentivise councils to consent more land. That is the public policy prescription that New Zealand needs. We do not need to fix the free market where it operates. We need to make the inherently interventionist housing market more efficient, and that requires better Government policy. There is a Santa Claus.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 20:56:39" ></a><strong>ANDREW LITTLE (Leader of the Opposition)</strong>: The only assertion that comes close to having an evidence base to it in Mr Seymour's speech just now is his statement that Santa does exist. We have heard a lot about this free market. There are some things about the free market that Mr Seymour has not articulated that I will come to, but perhaps I could reassure Mr Seymour this way: although it is official Labour policy that Santa does not exist, there is a possibility that there may be fairies at the bottom of the garden, and I am prepared to concede that point.</p><p class="a">The thing about free markets is this—if you want to have a free market there are a number of other conditions that have to apply, such as symmetry of information and equality of power, and that includes financial power as well. The reality is that in our housing market right now there is not equality of bargaining power through equality of financial power, there is definitely not symmetry of information—there is asymmetry of information—and all the evidence that is available to Mr Seymour, and everybody in this Committee, and the rest of New Zealand is that our housing market is just dysfunctional. How is it that in a country of 4.5 million people, in a city of l.5 million people, and when the average income is, what, $55,000, $57,000, we have an average house price of $1 million? That is not the mark of a functioning market; that is the mark of a dysfunctional market. So interventions are required.</p><p class="a">You could say the Government has heroically embarked upon housing accords and special housing areas as a justified intervention in the market. Certainly the objectives were good. Certainly the intentions were good. But, actually, when you look at the evidence and the practical effect of those special housing areas so far, they are not achieving what they were intended to achieve. Roughly a third of the special housing areas—only a third—have had houses built on them, which means two-thirds have not. We know that in special housing areas, set aside for the building of houses, including affordable houses—it simply has not happened in two-thirds of the special housing areas and the land available in those housing areas.</p><p class="a">The policy is not working. Noble as it is to say "Listen, let's extend it. Let's give it another 3 years.", that will be meaningless without Supplementary Order Paper 210 advanced by Metiria Turei requiring and specifying a proportion of affordably priced houses in those areas. That is vital—that is vital. That has been the missing element in the special housing areas programme so far.</p><p class="a">There have been some great projects in which affordable houses have been delivered, and some of them have been in special housing areas, and others have not. The truth is this—the reality is this—the need for affordable housing of a huge volume is now urgent. We now need urgent action to get affordable houses built. Getting special housing areas working properly, and a policy working properly, could be a solution. But it will be a solution only if they deliver affordable houses. It will not be a solution if we just extend the period during which special housing areas can be created and housing accords can continue to be activated, without a statutory mandate for a proportion of those houses to be affordable. That is what is needed.</p><p class="a">That is the Labour Party policy proposal. That is the Labour Party comprehensive housing package—to have a housing programme dedicated to affordable housing. That is the desperate shortage in New Zealand at the moment. Young couples, no matter how hard they work or save, cannot afford to buy their first home, and how could they when the proportion of their income—or the multiple of their income—required to buy a house, at least in Auckland, is now pushing 10 times that income? It is out of reach. If we are to stave off a bunch of other social issues, or social problems, further down the track, then the need to get affordable houses built in New Zealand today is utterly urgent.</p><p class="a">The bill as it stands at the moment, in this part, in Part 1, does not go far enough. We need a specific mandate, as provided for in the Supplementary Order Paper, for a proportion of affordable houses.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 21:01:42" ></a><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH (Minister for Building and Housing)</strong>: I do want to respond on three important points. The first is that members have claimed that you need to get the house price to income ratio back to 4, as is proposed in the Supplementary Order Paper (SOP). I challenge members to reflect on the history. There is actually only one period in New Zealand in which that ratio was less than 4, and that was when interest rates were at 15 percent.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Jono Naylor</strong>: How high?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: Fifteen percent. That is the only time. So the point is this: actually, you need to include interest rates in your measures of housing affordability, because, actually, whether it be the interest.co.nz index, or whether it be Massey University's index, it is absolutely proper to look at the proportion of a person's income in that criteria for affordability.</p><p class="a">The second thing is that there is a belief from Opposition members that putting an affordability criterion into each of the special housing areas (SHAs) will help. Let me tell you why that is incorrect. The experience that the Auckland Council has had, and the reason that the Auckland Council decided not to include affordability requirements in their plans—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: They got it wrong.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: I will explain why. It is important. It is because the developer has a choice as to whether they use the SHA mechanism or the normal planning process. If you put a whole lot of barriers in the way of the special housing area, the developer will simply choose to use the normal planning process, and you will defeat exactly what you need—more houses being built. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: So apply it to all developments then.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: Then Mr Twyford says: "Well, let's just apply it to all developments." I draw his attention to the evidence and the decision of the independent hearings panel, and I think every member in this Committee would accept the judge in that panel as an expert. Equally so, I would refer to the reports of both the OECD and the Productivity Commission that say those measures do not work, are counter-productive, and actually make houses less affordable, and the evidence is absolutely strong on that—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Rubbish! There is no consensus on that.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: Effectively, what Mr Twyford and Mr Little are saying is "No, the Productivity Commission got it wrong. No, the independent hearings panel got it wrong, and no, the Auckland Council got it wrong.", whereas the Government is saying: "Actually, the research shows it does not work."</p><p class="a">Let me give a very practical dimension. The original Auckland Council proposal was that if a housing development was more than 20 houses, it required a block of affordable houses. What the developers who were doing an 80 section block did was divide it into 19 section lots to be able to avoid that provision. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: There are ways of dealing with that.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: And he says: "There's ways of dealing with that." Actually, when you come to do a housing project, it is often the case that you will slice it up because of the capital costs of doing the investment.</p><p class="a">I will respond to one last point. The members have said: "Why is it that the Government insists on price points and affordability on the Government's Crown land programme, but not in the special housing areas?". There is a very good reason for that. When the Government owns the land, it can set the conditions about what occurs on the development, but if the land is privately owned, actually, you cannot force people to invest. If you have got a block of land, for instance, that is typically worth $10 million, and it is going to cost $30 million to build the infrastructure and to convert that into sections, I challenge Labour members to say how you will force people to invest that $30 million. That question they cannot answer. That is why those provisions do not work. That is why, actually, increasing housing supply is the key. This provision will do that, and Labour's opposition to these provisions shows that it is more interested in playing politics than actually getting roofs over the heads of Kiwi families.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 21:06:30" ></a><strong>DENIS O</strong><strong>'</strong><strong>ROURKE (NZ First)</strong>: I want to begin by making some comments about what the "Minister for Houselessness" said about affordability of housing in Christchurch because it is a most inappropriate example to use. As some others have indicated, the reason is that in Christchurch, as a result of the earthquake, huge amounts of Earthquake Commission and insurance money went in, and, as a result of demolitions, there was a lot of land that became available for building both in the central city and in the east. In addition to that, a lot of people simply moved out of Christchurch to areas immediately next door, like the Selwyn and Waimakariri districts. So the issue in Christchurch was not so much a land supply problem; it was actually, much more, a house supply problem because land always was, and still is, available. So you cannot use the Christchurch situation as a valid example of proving the effectiveness of Government policy. It is just not applicable.</p><p class="a">What is applicable and what is core to this issue is affordability, and that cannot—and I challenge the Minister for Building and Housing on this—just be solved by supply of land. There is a lot more to it than that because affordability refers to appropriate-sized sections for modest homes at prices that people can therefore afford. What is actually happening as a result of the free-market approach—which is really the approach supported by the Government—is that developers like to build larger homes on large sections because they get larger profits from doing it. It is no good the Minister shaking his head, because I have looked around in all parts of New Zealand, especially in Christchurch where I live, and tried to find a modest-sized home on a modest section for a reasonable price. It is very difficult to do. What is available are plenty of large expensive homes on large sections. So the market does not really solve the affordability problem as a result of just opening up supply.</p><p class="a">Affordability also refers to access to terms of purchase that people can handle, and that is the thrust of New Zealand First's policy. It divides the purchasing of a section—that we would assist them to do—with the building of a house, and if the security for the section is at second priority, people can still go out, therefore, and get a loan for a house on first mortgage and build their own home. That is the approach that we want to take. But affordability also—and this what the objective is of some of the Supplementary Order Papers that we have before us—applies to the total cost, whether it is within the range of people to finance or not. It is really as simple as that.</p><p class="a">Now David Seymour seems to think that the market will look after that as well, but that is not true—that is not true. There are so many people in this country who will never be able to finance their own home under current conditions. It is not just a supply issue; it is beyond that. It is an affordability issue. So just extending the time for special housing areas (SHAs) is not actually going to be enough at all. So I would like to ask the Minister: why has the Government not done more than just extend the period for SHAs in this legislation when there are so many other things it could do, not just to assist supply but to assist the problem of affordability?</p><p class="a">For that reason New Zealand First will support Supplementary Order Paper 210, because we would support anything that would assist that issue, although we do think that our policy is better than that set out in Supplementary Order Paper 210. Nevertheless, it is doing something positive, so we will support it. </p><p class="a">The Government, obviously, has no better ideas. It is just going to vote against that but not put anything in its place, and that is unsatisfactory. David Seymour seems to think that the market is going to be enough and the market will look after everything—just give them a free hand and away they will go. That is no way to address affordability. It will be a failure, as the Government's policy and proposals are.</p></div></body>

I withdraw my comment.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Chairperson. I wonder whether you could spend some time looking at a ruling the Speaker gave some time ago about personal offence.

[<em>Interruption</em>]</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The CHAIRPERSON (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: No, look, I do not need any help on this matter. I am happy to look at that point.

All you are doing is trifling with my decision.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Metiria Turei</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chair. My point of order is this: when Speaker Carter makes a ruling about the definition of personal offence in relation to the House, and you, Mr Chair, make a ruling that is different from his, how then are we to interpret, between the two rulings, what constitutes sufficient personal offence that another member will be required to withdraw and apologise? That is my point of order.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The CHAIRPERSON (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: Any member, if they feel offended by something that has been said—and it relates to a personal offence—has the right to protect their integrity, but—[<em>Interruption</em>] I am on my feet. The member David Seymour did take offence, and it is a very simple process to actually ask the member—in this case, Marama Davidson—to withdraw the comment, which she has done. Now we can continue.

What is a member to do when they are accurately reflecting—</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The CHAIRPERSON (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: No, that is a matter of opinion. The member has taken offence. That is all that I am concerned about. I have asked the member to withdraw. So I am ending the matter.

I ruled that if the member had taken personal offence, the member making the comment should withdraw the comment, which she subsequently did.</p><p class="a">In the meantime there were a number of points of order, including one from Metiria Turei that said that I was inconsistent with previous decisions that you, as Speaker, had made. The Hon Annette King made the point that I should consider the decision. I said that I would read the transcript and I would come back on the point that she had brought up, and that I would consider again and report back. I have been consistent over the period of time when someone has taken personal offence—that it is an offence against that person's integrity—and I believe that if someone feels offended by such a comment, in order to protect the integrity of that person the person making that accusation should, in fact, withdraw the comment, which in this case the member did. We were then to move on, but you have been recalled.</p></div></body>

The first was the question of the definition of "personal offence". In previous rulings you have made, you have said that where there is personal offence taken, it is offence to the House as a whole, not to the individual. However, the Chair did rule that because Mr Seymour had taken personal offence himself, that was sufficient to ask my colleague to withdraw and apologise. They are two different definitions of "personal offence", and we sought clarification on which of those definitions should apply.</p><p class="a">The second matter was that my colleague was described as a female having female fury righteousness in the debate earlier this afternoon by Mr Seymour. She referred to that comment in her contribution during the Committee stage. Mr Seymour took offence at her reference to his previous statement about her in this debate, and there is a question now about whether or not a member is able to stand and repeat the statements made by other members in this House about themselves, and then be required to withdraw and apologise for that statement.

My colleague is prepared to accept that she did not get the quote completely correct—once we saw the transcript from Hansard—but, none the less, there still remains the central questions here as to that matter in a debate such as we are having, which is that a member should be able to stand and reflect on the comments made by other members that are made about themselves. And, second, what is the definition of "personal offence" that we are to use in this House? Is it an offence to the individual member of Parliament, or is it an offence to the House? We have had long debates on that. It is now more confusing than ever.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 21:25:40" ></a><strong>CHRIS HIPKINS (Senior Whip—Labour)</strong>: I think in considering that matter there is a need to draw a distinction between whether a member feels they have been misrepresented and whether a member takes offence at a matter, because the remedies for those things are different. If a member feels they have been misrepresented, then there are steps that they can take in order to seek to have that corrected, and the threshold for that would be, if you like, more lenient than for offence. The threshold has to be reasonable for offensiveness, or otherwise we will have members taking offence at everything other members say that they disagree with. But if they feel that they have been misrepresented in the debate, then there are ways that they can seek to correct it. But asking a member to withdraw or apologise, or both, for a comment that a member feels might misrepresent what they have said but that is not in itself offensive, is going to lead the House into a state of quite regular disorder, I would have thought.</p></div></body>

If a member of Parliament stands up and refers to something that somebody has said, particularly if it is a personal comment about them, they should be able to debate, to mention that personal comment, and to make their own analysis about that comment without concern about it being taken as a personal offence. If it is a misrepresentation, then that is a legitimate position for another member to take. But to then use personal offence to force them to withdraw and apologise over a comment that was made about them does not make any sense, and we still get back to the primary issue, which is: what is the definition of "personal offence" that is used by the Speaker?</p></div></body>

I was involved in a meeting, so I was not listening to the debate as we led into this. So it is a difficult one for me to sense. The tension was here. I do acknowledge that it is a vigorous debate. We are in a situation where we are in urgency. We are debating something that is, obviously, finely balanced within this House on the votes that have been taken, and it is something that is not going to be aired before a select committee.</p><p class="a">As to the issue of when offence is taken, you cannot define it exactly. It occurs at a time when offence could be taken by a member. There are times when I have ruled that offence has been taken. I have been surprised that offence has been taken, and I have said that, but if offence is taken and that creates disorder, then a presiding officer, as Mr Tisch has done in this case, will accept that the member has taken offence and ask that that comment be withdrawn. Many times when I have made that decision I have made it without actually hearing the interjection myself; I have relied on the fact that a member said he is offended. If he is offended, it is an offence to the whole House—[<em>Interruption</em>] Order! On this occasion that is what has happened here.</p><p class="a">The presiding officer, Mr Tisch, has been the Chair; he has been judging the proceedings. It is his job to keep order in the House. Without doubt, offence was taken. All members can judge whether offence should have been taken. Mr Tisch has decided that the way to then maintain the dignity and the order in this House is to require the member to then withdraw that comment. If it had been more offensive, he may have taken the option of asking the member to withdraw and apologise, but, as I understand it, he did not do that. He simply asked for it to be withdrawn, and I further understand that the member then did withdraw that remark. So on that basis, I completely back Mr Tisch, as he is attempting to maintain order in this Chamber during what has been, without doubt, a fairly tense discussion over the last hour.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 21:31:35" ></a><strong>METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green)</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Can I just get clarity, then, that it is a legitimate point of order for taking personal offence for a male member to be, in his own mind, in whatever way, accused of sexism, but it is not a legitimate point of order for personal offence for a female member who takes offence at being told she backs rapists.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 21:32:04" ></a><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! No, I think I covered that in the very first part by saying there are times when remarks will be made and offence will then be taken at that remark, and a presiding officer needs to immediately decide how best to maintain order. So I am not going to comment on a particular comment that was made as to whether it meets a threshold. A presiding officer, in this case, is required to maintain order in the House. Mr Tisch chose to accept that Mr Seymour had been offended by the comment, and he then asked the member to withdraw. That member did withdraw. That is my final decision.</p></div></body>

All sorts of things have been flying across the Chamber, including from the member David Seymour, about me and my speeches. I have not once chosen to stand and take offence at any of them because this is a vigorous debate and I am up for it, including right now. And, actually, after all of this, all I was going to say and suggest to Mr David Seymour was that he do what I do, which is completely ignore him. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Jono Naylor</strong>: But you didn't. You didn't ignore him.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MARAMA DAVIDSON</strong>: No, no, the only way I found out about what he said about me is that I got tweeted it. I got tweeted it. I found out later on what the member had said about me because people were hilariously laughing at it. So that is how I found out. Other than that, my advice is that what I do is ignore him.</p><p class="a">So I will just carry on from there and say that what I wanted to outline in this contribution, what I have got left, is that I wanted to acknowledge the Ihumātao campaign against this special housing area (SHA) and support what my tungāne, my colleague Peeni Henare, of Tāmaki Makaurau, has said. What I want to go back to very, very strongly is that the Ihumātao community and the land it is trying to protect is right adjacent to some incredible, ancient stone archaeological sites—incredible. The land that was proposed for this SHA—Part 1 of this bill extends the fast tracking. So we have to remember that that was confiscated land. That was confiscated land.</p><p class="a">The Ihumātao campaign to oppose this SHA, this special housing area, under the original legislation—I went to the Auckland Council governance meetings as well as the select committee meetings and listened to the presentation from the Ihumātao campaigners about protecting their land. You know what happened: both the council hearings and the parliamentary select committee hearings—across the House, across the parties—agreed that this was a bit of a mistake, this one. The approval for this one was a bit of a sham, and there was sympathy across all of the parties for the muck up in this particular legislation.</p><p class="a">So I did want to bring the Ihumātao community and the people into the Committee tonight under Part 1 of this legislation, because—too late, too late—there was even sympathy and agreement across the parties and at Auckland Council. See, this is what happens when you fast track the information. If Auckland Council had known properly and had all the information in front of it, it admits that it would have made a different decision. This is what happens and can happen with this fast-tracked legislation, and this is what I wanted to put to the Committee in respect of Part 1 of this bill. So they all admitted this and had some sympathy.</p><p class="a">I actually want to acknowledge that Nick Smith went to this community. He did. He gave them an ear, but it was too late—it was too late. He had already signed it off. That is what this fast-track process did. He is stuck with it now. He is stuck with that legacy of this wrong decision for the Ihumātao community to not have their precious ancient "Stonehenge" land protected under this fast-tracked consenting process. So that needs to be strongly acknowledged in this Committee, and I wanted to stand and do that.</p><p class="a">I am sorry that David Seymour was offended at the start of my speech for something—all I was doing was giving an innocent synopsis of how he refers to me. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 21:37:32" ></a><strong>Hon DAVID PARKER (Labour)</strong>: Before I address why we need this transitional provision, can I say that I agree with other members who have said that this bill is inadequate to deal with the issues that are facing New Zealand in housing. I agree with something that Julie Anne Genter said: that these problems have become so problematic in New Zealand that they are causing economy-wide effects, not just having an effect on the housing market.</p><p class="a">The problems are so problematic that they are causing problems beyond the housing market. It is true that some of the marginal price pressure comes from overseas buyers. It is true that that is driving demand for New Zealand currency, which is higher than it would otherwise be. It is true that it is suppressing the value of our exports and increasing our current account deficit. It is also true that it is distorting the investment signal within New Zealand so that more money is going into speculative asset classes and not enough is going to productive asset classes.</p><p class="a">Having said that, I want to address another point that I do not think has been properly addressed. I want the Minister for Building and Housing to explain why we are having to do this piece of legislation—why—when the special housing areas did not come into creation until after the plan-making process was legislated for the Auckland Plan. Why was it not contemplated at the time of the special housing legislation that there was a need to ensure that the plans that were going to be made for the special housing areas would not be cut across by the Auckland Plan? As the explanatory note says—in the third dot point—the purpose of this bill is to "allow plan change requests made but not completed under the [Special Housing Areas] Act to continue when proposed district plans become operative:".</p><p class="a">So the first time that that could have been fixed was when the special housing legislation was passed, to have made that clear. The Minister shakes his head. It could have been done that way, Minister. You know that that is correct. The second way it could have been fixed is that one of the many arms of Government—one of the many billions of dollars that the Government spends every year could have been spent on making a submission to the Auckland Plan's hearing panel that it should have made provision for the protection of planning processes that were under way in—[<em>Interruption</em>] They could have. Again, the Minister shakes his head. Of course it could have gone to those people who were hearing that and they could have said "Please don't cut across the plans that are halfway through or about to be lodged, or give us a transitional period of 3 years.", which is the transitional period that it wants under this legislation. It could have at least asked the planning authority in Auckland to put the same provision in the Auckland Plan.</p><p class="a">That would have been far cheaper. The Government would not have to be coming to Parliament and pushing this through under urgency. The Minister shakes his head as if this could not have been done by the Auckland Plan if it had wanted to. The Auckland Plan could have said that in respect of areas that are special housing areas the planning process that is under way in respect of those under the special housing legislation shall have an effect for another 3 years. It could have done that. The Minister shakes his head and said: "Did they apply?". Did you try? Did anyone from the Government go to the planning authority?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: It would be unlawful.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon DAVID PARKER</strong>: It would have been unlawful? Rubbish. It would not have been unlawful. It would not have been unlawful for someone to turn up and say "We need the planning processes that we've started for the special housing areas to continue.", and they could have said that in respect of the special housing areas this planning provision will apply—i.e., the one that we are doing.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Amy Adams made a submission.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon DAVID PARKER</strong>: Amy Adams made a submission, but the Minister for Building and Housing did not—the Minister for Building and Housing did not. I am aghast that it did not get it right in the original Act. It did not get it right in submissions on the plan, and, therefore, the hearings commissioners do not even address it in their plan—they do not even address it in their plan. Do they address it in their plan?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: You are just incorrect.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon DAVID PARKER</strong>: But they do not address it in there. I bet they did not because the Government did not ask them to. I would like the Minister to explain why it was that they did not submit on the plan and protect these planning provisions in the special housing areas. I cannot understand why that did not occur.

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 21:42:45" ></a><strong>Hon DAVID CUNLIFFE (Labour—New Lynn)</strong>: I wish to make a reasonably technical contribution to this discussion, specifically around clause 5 of Part 1, which I do not believe has been addressed yet in the discussion. There are many, many clauses that we have not yet touched upon in this debate on Part 1. Before I do, may I make a brief comment in respect of the previous exchange. I am sure you will reflect on the ability of members to cause offence or otherwise in stating their understanding—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The CHAIRPERSON (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: This is out of order. Just continue with the debate. Concentrate on the bill.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon DAVID CUNLIFFE</strong>: Clause 5 requires two new subsections be added to the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act. The first is that an Order in Council "may incorporate a map, plan, or document prepared or issued by any person or body." That is a very significant, although ostensibly technical, amendment. Let me comment in two parts. The first is to replace what would have been a requirement for technical and specific language with any range of map, plan, or document. It is therefore possible—indeed, probably intended—that that move would make it easier for a special housing area (SHA) to cover a broader area, a broader range, a larger quantum of development. In considering that, the Committee has to take account of the rights that attach to normal consenting processes that are necessarily abrogated by this extension of the SHA process. Those are serious issues.</p><p class="a">The next part of that subsection I think adds to that serious question, and that is because this map or plan may be issued "by any person or body."—not a territorial authority, not a regional authority, not the Auckland Council, but perhaps by a developer, perhaps by an interest group, perhaps by the Tree Council, perhaps by Greenpeace, or perhaps by the Property Council. The point, as members can readily see, is that the uncertainty that this creates is both unnecessary and significant, given the fact that the rest of clause 5 seeks to extend and abrogate rights that are extant in the law as it stands. It is unclear—and I invite the Minister for Building and Housing to comment, because we are fortunate to have the responsible Minister in the chair—what the reasoning is behind this specific clause. Is it, perchance, the result of developer pressure for an even faster and more speedy process? Is it to abrogate the democratic processes of, perchance, the Auckland Council or other territorial authorities? Or is there a more sanguine explanation that is not apparent to members of this House? I am sure the Minister will want to comment on that.</p><p class="a">May I reflect on the fact that there is an interesting contradistinction between this clause that the Minister has added, which allows a policy change to be done by a broad area, a large group, of housing opportunities and the contrasting approach that the same Government—I think, possibly, the same Minister—took in regard to the tree-trimming regulations in Auckland, where it removed just such an ability and required people who wanted to protect something, in this case special trees, to do it by the individual tree, which had to be specified by a long and bureaucratic process of the council. In fact, more trees probably died for the paperwork required by that highly specific amendment. And in this bill, the same Minister is doing the exact opposite. To protect something, you have to be specific to the individual tree or—thanks to Mr Goff's pressure, perhaps, a very small group of trees—but if you want to develop something, you can do it by anybody providing a map. Imagine Captain Cook providing a map—he could do the whole country in one go. I mean, the point is, the clause—that might sound ridiculous—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Jono Naylor</strong>: Nothing more ridiculous than what you've been saying all night.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon DAVID CUNLIFFE</strong>: —does not self-limit. Mr Jono would be best to constrain his interventions to something that has substance. He has made his speech. Mr Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to ask the Minister to comment on this, and I hope he will.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160906 21:47:40" ></a><strong>PHIL TWYFORD (Labour—Te Atatū)</strong>: I want to quote the Hon Dr Nick Smith. In 2013, at the time of the first reading of the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Bill, Dr Smith said: "The bill isn't a silver bullet for the problem but a much needed interim measure while the Government's longer term work programme to address housing affordability beds in." So 3 years ago this was some kind of interim measure, but now the Government needs another 3 years while it desperately hopes that the special housing areas (SHAs) will deliver some kind of result. </p><p class="a">Will this Minister ever do anything more than the chronic piecemeal tinkering that passes for a housing policy? Will he? Will he ever do anything more than tinker around the edges?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>David Seymour</strong>: Tell us, Phil. What would the member do?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>PHIL TWYFORD</strong>: David Seymour says this bill is "little more than ad hoc tinkering." Well, I agree with David Seymour on this. That is all it is: ad hoc tinkering. </p><p class="a">Let us consider some of the provisions in this bill. Clause 5 amends section 16 of the Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act (HASHAA), which provides for the establishment of SHAs. New section 16(4A) allows an Order in Council to define the boundaries of an SHA—blah, blah. Clause 6 replaces section 18 of the HASHAA and allows SHAs to be disestablished, and then there are a whole series of criteria about disestablishment. Section 18(3) currently provides for the early disestablishment of an SHA. </p><p class="a">It is a bureaucratic nightmare. It is the product of this Minister's mind—a Minister who for 10 years has been blaming the Resource Management Act (RMA) and blaming councils for producing an uncompetitive urban land market. He has done nothing substantial about it, and this is what he is reduced to: a bureaucratic exercise in micromanaging urban land markets. It is a massive bureaucratic exercise, with a whole lot of bureaucrats writing little lines on maps and saying: "You can do this. You can't do that. Now it's time to do that. If you don't do this by a certain period, we're going to disestablish you." It is a Kafkaesque nightmare. </p><p class="a">Minister, why do you not just follow through on the rhetoric that you have been spouting for 10 years and actually genuinely reform the planning process? Why do you not abolish the urban growth boundary and introduce a smarter way of managing urban growth? Why do you not protect the special environmental areas, invest in rapid transit growth to support new development, and genuinely reform infrastructure financing? But you will not. The Minister will not do that. All he does is tinker. </p><p class="a">I asked the member for Epsom, who claims to believe in competitive land markets, who wants to see the cost of urban land go down, because he understands that the high price of urban land is at the heart of the housing crisis in Auckland. Well, it is fine for the Minister to nod his head like that. He has been saying things like that for 10 years, but he has done absolutely nothing about it. He had his chance with the draft national policy statement. That was his opportunity to genuinely reform the restrictive planning and zoning system that creates an artificial scarcity of land and drives up urban land values and makes affordable housing impossible in our biggest city. </p><p class="a">The national policy statement was his opportunity to make change. But what did he do? He produced a draft national policy statement that implemented a giant bureaucratic mechanism, telling councils that they had to project the future need for development land, and then, if they did not think there was enough, they had to increase the amount of land in supply. An incremental infusion of land into a highly speculative land market bears no resemblance to what the Minister and Bill English have been wittering on about for a decade, talking about uncompetitive land markets. What an incredible disappointment. </p><p class="a">This Minister is in the twilight of his career. He has been mouthing off about reforming the planning system, driving down the cost of urban land, all these years—blaming the RMA and blaming councils.</p></div></body>

If my colleague has been accused of being sanctimonious, just wait for what I have got. I wonder what the people sitting in the motels who have been sent there by Work and Income because they have got nowhere to live, watching Parliament TV—because what else would you do; I am sure they are all glued to the screen—think about this bill. I wonder how those people feel, listening to this technical and arcane debate, when what they want is somewhere to live that they can afford. I wonder what they think about the special housing areas rhetoric, which turns out to be business as usual. It turns out to be the Government saying "We're doing something by not really doing something.", which is quite a familiar theme to any observer of Parliament. </p><p class="a">I wonder how it feels for the people who testified at the Cross-Party Homelessness Inquiry, when they read Part 1 of this bill and look for the innovative, committed, and justice-based provisions that are going to provide them with a home. I wonder what they think of us, as they know we are going home to comfortable homes and they are going back to the car, the garage, or the transience of 22 different homes in 3 years for a child. </p><p class="a">We call this a debate about housing? This is not a debate about housing; this is about some weird excuse for acting on something that the Government has not got the guts to call a crisis. Why are we in urgency? Because this is a crisis—it is a crisis of conscience for this Parliament to sit here, in 2016, and make up rules about housing that will assist and facilitate developers but do nothing for the people who are shut out. They are shut out from $200,000 homes, let alone $500,000 or $600,000 homes. </p><p class="a">Get real for a change, people. Do these people who write this legislation know what it is like to have no home? I will listen to Marama Davidson and Metiria Turei because they know—because Marama is a renter in South Auckland. Why do we not listen to the renters in South Auckland and the people who have parked up for homes? They know what the people are going through. It is too late in the history of this time to treat people as if homelessness was something that could be fixed by some bizarre tinkering with the market. It cannot be fixed by that. </p><p class="a">The people on the streets are looking at us for guidance and leadership right now, and what are we giving them? Special housing areas over sacred sites in Tāmaki-makau-rau. When I was a child my parents bought a house through the State Advances Corporation. When I became an adult, I capitalised the family benefit so that I could have a kitchen and bathroom for my child, on a floor that was not sloping. I was lucky to be born in that dreadful old socialist welfare terrible era when the State thought that people could have a house, that it would help them do it, and that when they had it, we could get on with our lives as families and build a society and a community that worked. This Government has walked away from that. </p><p class="a">I am not asking for a romantic, latte-free 1950s reality; I am just asking for the State to take responsibility for a crisis. I am just asking that we actually pass legislation here that will facilitate for those who really need it, not for those people who like to play the market and who want to invest in a couple of homes. If this bill did what it said it does, then Metiria would not need a Supplementary Order Paper and no one would be calling Marama Davidson sanctimonious because she stands up every day in this House for her own people, who are constantly marginalised by privilege. </p><p class="a">But that is not what is happening in this bill. We are in urgency because this issue is so simple that we do not want the public to talk about it. If this Parliament had a solution, why would it go into urgency and prevent people from coming and discussing that solution? It is only because this is not a solution that we are having this conversation and blocking out the public. It is a disgrace.</p></div></body>

Why are we here, and what is this bill that we are debating? The bill that we are debating extends the time frame for the special housing areas. It extends the time frame in which they can be established until 16 September 2019, and it delays the repeal of the whole Act until 16 September 2021. So why are we here doing this under urgency? Why is this so urgent that the entirety of Parliament has to grind to a halt to push this through under urgency? Was this unexpected? Was the Minister of Housing who drafted the legislation in the first place—who put the dates in the original legislation in the first place—unaware when he wrote that that those were actually going to be the dates at which the law expired and the dates at which further special housing areas were not going to be able to be established? If so, why did it take until this week for him to bring something to the House to do something about that? </p><p class="a">A Minister who was vaguely competent in administering the legislation that they themselves had written would have been able to anticipate that this was going to be an issue, and would have been able to address that through the regular legislative process. So why are we here? Why are we here under urgency—through the night, tomorrow, however long it takes—in order to change these dates for the special housing areas, when the Government could have done that months ago but chose not to? The Government could have done that at any point since the passage of the previous legislation, had it wanted to. It could have changed the dates if it had wanted to, and it chose not to, so why are we here? Why are we debating this under urgency when the Government could have dealt with these issues had it chosen to do so? It is because of the utter, utter incompetent administration of all of the issues around housing. </p><p class="a">I want to turn my attention to the provision of affordable housing, in particular, because the departmental disclosure statement makes the observation that of the special housing areas already established, there are around 75 percent of them that have up to 10 percent affordable housing. </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Debate interrupted.</p><p class="CentredEndingBold"><em>Sitting suspended from </em><em>10 p.m.</em><em> to </em><em>9 a.m. (Wednesday</em>)</p></div></body>
