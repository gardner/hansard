I just want to make a comment, and I hope you will allow me to do this, around the ruling that you made about the oral questions roster. Mr Speaker, obviously, you have the right to make the rulings that you do, but the Labour Party wants to register its strong concern with the ruling that you made that allows a member of the executive to continue to be counted in the calculation of the number of oral questions available to the Government.</p><p class="a">It does not matter who that particular member is; it is about the position that they hold within the executive. For the purpose of questions,<em> </em><em>McGee</em> is quite clear that members who hold executive office—Ministers, Associate Ministers, and parliamentary under-secretaries—are excluded from the calculation of the number of questions available to Government parties. This is, clearly, not just about the National Party; it is about all parties in the Government.</p><p class="a">I think, in your ruling, Mr Speaker, that you acknowledged the fact that, actually, under the rules and guidance that this Parliament operates under, members of the executive should not be counted. Just because we have begun operating under a process that has proved to be incorrect, does not mean we should continue to do so, and the Labour Party strongly believes that members of the executive should not be counted and that we should not go ahead with a process that we all know to be wrong.</p></div></body>

Given that—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon </strong><strong>Member</strong>: Funny that.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon GERRY </strong><strong>BROWNLEE</strong>: Well, we are now 20 years into MMP and there have been a number of evolutions over the last 20 years that have come as a result of arrangements that parties make around MMP. I would make the point that during his time as Clerk of the House, McGee himself not only presided over but advised on a number of changes to the Standing Orders that were, as a consequence of practice, developed by Governments in support of the Government's position on MMP. So I think your decision simply continues that evolution, and I am sure that the Standing Orders Committee will be able to make a determination for future Parliaments that reflects the advice you have given the House today.</p></div></body>

The net effect of your decision to date is to maintain the size of Parliament relative to the executive in respect of the allocation of questions, and I think that having Parliament hold the executive to account is a very important function of this House.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 14:04:56" ></a><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I thank all members for their contributions on this. It is a difficult issue. It was discussed at length at the Business Committee yesterday, and I attempted to drive a decision to be made by the Business Committee. My job there is to drive that to near unanimity. That proved to be more difficult on this occasion than on many others. Although I accept, with some validity, the arguments advanced by Mr Robertson, I do not think it is quite as clear as Mr Robertson is suggesting, and that is why I do request that this matter be absolutely clarified through the review of the Standing Orders so that there can be no confusion in the future.</p><p class="a">For those members who have not had a chance to see the decision, the Business Committee has, in the past, allocated questions, and it last made a decision back in April of this year. In view of the fact that we could not get agreement to change the roster in any way, either to reflect the fact that we have had one recent retirement from Labour or to reflect the decision around parliamentary under-secretaries being able to ask questions, I have decided that the safest way for me is to just stick with the decision that was made by the Business Committee without any difficulty at all back in April. That is the situation that remains until the matter is tidied up through the review of the Standing Orders, which will come into effect without any confusion for the 52nd Parliament.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="QOA"><strong>ORAL QUESTIONS</strong></p><p class="QType"><strong>QUESTIONS TO MINISTERS</strong></p><h4 class="QSubjectHeading"><strong>Building</strong><strong> and Housing, Minister—</strong><strong>Confidence</strong></h4><p class="SubsQuestion"><strong>1. </strong><strong>ANDREW LITTLE (Leader of the Opposition</strong><strong>)</strong> to the <strong>Prime </strong><strong>Minister</strong>: Does he have confidence in his Minister for Building and Housing, given the nearly 8,000 shortfall in new houses in Auckland in the past year?</p><p class="SubsAnswer"><a name="time_20161102 14:07:11" ></a><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY (Prime Minister)</strong>: Yes, I do have confidence in the Minister, and I think the member really should take a good look at the facts. Statistics New Zealand reported this week that almost 30,000 residential building consents were issued across New Zealand in the year to September. That is more than double what they were 5 years ago, and momentum is increasing. Of these, nearly 10,000 consents were in Auckland, which is almost three times the number just 5 years ago.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: What impact has the $273,000 increase in Mount Roskill house prices over the past 2 years had on young people there hoping to buy their own home?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Obviously, for any first-home buyer a rise in house prices has some impact, but, of course, the most substantial impact for those young people in Mount Roskill probably is, firstly, that they are paying interest rates that are at record lows. For someone borrowing $300,000, let alone, potentially, a bigger mortgage in Auckland, that saves them thousands and thousands and thousands—I think $16,000 in the hand. Secondly, as we can see today from the very strong employment growth in New Zealand, the good people of Mount Roskill are probably finding it a lot easier to get a job. Thirdly, I think the good people of Mount Roskill probably saw last week that this is a country that is No. 1 now in terms of ease of doing business. We have some of the best economic statistics in the OECD, and they have probably got a little bounce in their step. So the member might want to talk New Zealand down, but I do not think the people of Mount Roskill are.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: Given Quotable Value says that the median Mount Roskill house has increased in value by $2,300 each week for the last 2 years, how are young people meant to save for a deposit for their first home?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: There are a number of ways, of course, that we do that. The first is with a strong employment market with very low interest rates—that certainly helps them. Secondly, KiwiSaver HomeStart will, without doubt, help young people. Thirdly, if you look at the comprehensive plan that we have got, obviously what is happening there is that you are seeing an enormous construction boom now happening in Auckland. In fact, if anything, the reason the member did not ask a question on housing yesterday was that, as he knows himself, he is actually starting to run out of puff on it.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Todd Barclay</strong>: What reports has he received confirming employment growth in the construction sector, which is being driven by a building boom across much of New Zealand?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: What an outstanding question. As part of the latest household labour force survey, Statistics New Zealand today reported that the number of people employed in the construction sector increased to a whopping 226,000 in September. That is 21,000 more construction jobs than 2 years ago, and 55,000 more than 5 years ago, confirming that the building sector is indeed booming. These extra construction jobs contributed to New Zealand's overall unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent in September, the lowest level since December 2008. Across New Zealand, there are a total of 35,000 more jobs than just 3 months ago, and 30,000 fewer people unemployed. Over the past year, 144,000 more people are in work. What a day of great celebration for the Government.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: Why, under his Government, are 80 percent of adults under 40 in Mount Roskill renters, with just 20 percent owning their own home? What is there to celebrate about that?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I do not know the relative statistics as to what it was like 10 years ago, but I suspect it has not actually changed dramatically in that period of time. But what is true is that if you look at Mt Roskill, it is actually becoming—there is no question—a wealthier electorate there in Auckland. If you look at the massive construction boom that is now taking place in Auckland—as I said just a moment before; I will not bother repeating it for the House—there are a huge number of extra people who are working in the construction sector. We have interest rates that are at a 60-year low and we have very strong employment growth. The people of Mount Roskill and New Zealand are quite chipper about the outlook for New Zealand.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Jacqui Dean</strong>: What measures has the Minister for Building and Housing overseen as part of the Government's comprehensive plan to increase the number of houses being built?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Yet again, another outstanding question. There have been many parts of the Government's comprehensive housing plan. We have set up the billion-dollar Housing Infrastructure Fund. We have created over 200 special housing areas for around 70,000 new homes across the country. We have extended legislation to enable special housing areas to be created for another 3 years. We have expanded the KiwiSaver HomeStart scheme for first-home buyers. We signed off on a National Policy Statement on Urban Development, and we are getting the Auckland Unitary Plan under way. The plan was so comprehensive that yesterday the Labour Party gave up on housing, because it can see that the market is stabilising and that construction is booming in Auckland.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: Talking of special housing areas, how many of the exactly 18 affordable homes that have been built in Auckland special housing areas are in Mount Roskill? Would he be surprised to know that, actually, it is zero?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: If the member is asking a question that he says he knows the answer to, he is really wasting the House's time asking the question. But the reason he is asking the question is that his numbers are always so dodgy and proven to be incorrect. It is not 18 houses. As of 2016, in Auckland 1,300 homes have been completed in special housing areas, 2,200 building consents have been issued, 2,458 new sections have been created, and 7,170 new sections have been granted resource consents. I go back to what I said earlier: the reason the Labour Party did not ask yesterday is that it has given up—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order!</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: Is the Prime Minister aware that the Three Kings Quarry housing project would put 1,300 new homes in the Mt Roskill electorate, a large portion of which would be affordable, and that the lead opponent of these homes over the past 5 years has been the former chair of the local board, Mr Michael Wood, the Labour candidate? [<em>Interruption</em>] </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! It is question time, not a football match.</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Well, it could be, because we are kicking all the goals. I was aware of that, actually. I was aware of that and, you know, I would not expect anything different, because it is the same Michael Wood who does not believe in dodgy deals, except he has done one with the Greens to get himself over the line—or, at least, he wants to but because his potential leader is so worried, he is offering $1.4 billion worth of light rail, which, actually, the former member for Mt Roskill does not even support. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! We are moving into an area where there is no prime ministerial responsibility.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: Getting back to matters of fact—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon </strong><strong>Members</strong>: Oh!</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: Oh, it hurts, it hurts! Why, after 8 years of his Government, has the homeownership rate fallen to its lowest level in 65 years?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: There are a number of factors as to why homeownership rates around the world have been falling, but I think we can see, by the construction numbers, the consent numbers, and the employment numbers that we have seen, how much construction is now taking place. We can see that the elements of the plan are not only actually working in Auckland but, I think, starting to work around New Zealand, and I am confident that the housing markets will stabilise over time and more supply will be there.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Andrew Little</strong>: When is he going to stop dragging the chain and admit that Labour's plan to build 100,000 affordable homes for first-home buyers is the only way to restore the Kiwi Dream?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I suggest that the people who believe that Labour is going to build 100,000 homes go there on the light rail that they believe is going to be delivered to Mount Roskill in the next 3 years.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><h4 class="QSubjectheadingalone"><strong>Prime</strong><strong> Minister—</strong><strong>Statements</strong></h4><p class="SubsQuestion"><strong>2. </strong><strong>RON MARK (Deputy Leader—NZ First</strong><strong>)</strong> to the <strong>Prime </strong><strong>Minister</strong>: Does he stand by all his statements?</p><p class="SubsAnswer"><a name="time_20161102 14:17:43" ></a><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY (Prime Minister)</strong>: Yes, particularly the one I made yesterday when I said that after New Zealand First's performance yesterday in the House I could not wait for Winston to come back.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Ron Mark</strong>: In light of his recent trip to India, does he stand by his statement in relation to fraudulent agents that he "won't be raising it" but "expects it to be discussed"; if so, why did he not raise the issue when he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Because that is not the single biggest issue that I would discuss with Prime Minister Modi. That is because about 30,000 students each year come from India and the absolutely overwhelming bulk of them come into New Zealand legally and with the appropriate paperwork. The fact that there are a few unscrupulous agents in India is a matter, of course, to be dealt with and that is why we are putting extra resources in India while we will be putting more pressure on the institutions themselves to know their agents. But I really do not think it would be the No. 1 issue to talk to the leader of India about when we can talk about free trade and a variety of other issues.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Ron Mark</strong>: So can you tell the House again why you did not raise this issue given that 35,230 student visa applications have been processed in connection to education agents that have had an alert or a client warning placed on them by Immigration New Zealand's Mumbai area office since 2010? </p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I do not have all those details, and if he wants the specific details he really should go and put it down to the appropriate Minister, but I make the simple point that, yes, there are people who apply and whom the system correctly picks up and rejects. The vast, overwhelming bulk who come here are people who are lawful and entitled to be here and, hopefully, get a very good education, and some of them stay and some of them go home. But, in the end, the way for us to make sure that we protect the integrity of our system is that people follow the rules. If they do not follow the rules, then we have a way of dealing with that. I am pretty confident that, overall, the system works well.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Ron </strong><strong>Mark</strong>: I seek the leave of the House to table a document entitled "Total number of education agents that have an alert or client warning since 2010". The date is 20 October; the source is an Official Information Request (OIA) response from Immigration New Zealand.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that particular OIA response. Is there any objection to it being tabled? There is none. </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Ron Mark</strong>: Can he tell the House again why he did not raise the issue, considering that Immigration New Zealand has conducted 70 investigations into fraudulent activity regarding international students since 2010, resulting in 265 students being liable for deportation? Why did he not raise it, considering that?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: There was a discussion with the Indian Prime Minister about the benefits of export education and about the benefits that New Zealand institutions, which do a very good job, can bring to helping educate those young people. There was certainly feedback that those young people are enjoying their experience in New Zealand. I do not think it would be for me to go to the Prime Minister of India and say to him that he should go and sort out a couple of his agents. It would be nice if he did not have anything else to do all day, but given that he has got 1.27 billion people to look after, he is probably just a little bit busier than Mr Mark is. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Ron </strong><strong>Mark</strong>: I seek the leave of the House to table a document entitled "Total number of investigations by Immigration New Zealand into international students since 2010". The date is 20 October; the source is an OIA response from Immigration New Zealand.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that particular OIA response. Is there any objection? There is none.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Ron Mark</strong>: If more than 163 student applications have illegally entered New Zealand via fraud, and that is only in the 2015-16 financial year, then why did he not think it was an important enough issue to raise in those discussions with the Prime Minister of India?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Because in the discussions I had with the Indian Prime Minister, there were some big objectives we were trying to achieve, one of which is advancing a free-trade agreement with the country that is going to be the most populated by 2026. Yes, there are one or two agents in India that are not following the rules, and that is why the Government has beefed up its representation there. But the member last week was on TV bleating about the fact that I should not be going to India, and today he is in the House bleating on about the fact that I did not ask the questions he liked. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Ron </strong><strong>Mark</strong>: I seek the leave of the House to table a document entitled "Total number of student visa applications that have entered New Zealand via fraud, 2015-16 financial year". The date is 20 October; the source is an OIA response from Immigration New Zealand.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that particular OIA response. Any objection? There is none. </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Ron Mark</strong>: If the New Delhi area office declines 60 percent of partner student applications after an investigation into "convenience-based marriages" by student visa applicants, why did he not think that that was an important enough issue to raise with the Indian Prime Minister?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: The fact that there are applications that are being declined—and I simply make the point that they are being declined by all countries, from what we can see, that are offering export education opportunities—actually shows you that for the most part the system is working.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Ron </strong><strong>Mark</strong>: I seek the leave of the House to table a document entitled "Analysis report on the convenience-based partnerships at New Delhi area office". The date is 11 August 2016; the source is an Official Information Act request from Immigration New Zealand. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that particular OIA response. Any objection? There is none. It can be tabled. </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Ron Mark</strong>: If the Mumbai area office is circulating a weekly fraud update uncovering weekly cases of fraudulent activity through dispersal letters, bank documents, recycled bank documents, and imposters pretending to be someone else, among others, why did he not consider that this was an important enough issue to discuss with the Prime Minister of India? </p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Some people could make the case that the member is trying to pretend he is the leader of New Zealand First. Anyway, I digress for a moment. The main issue here, of course, is that, as I said earlier, no one is arguing that there are not some agents in India who are acting inappropriately, and we would be concerned if our office was not picking them up—but the vast overwhelming bulk are. We have increased the number of people in India to help deal with that, and we are dealing with the individual institutions. The vast overwhelming bulk of the 30,000 Indian students who come to New Zealand have arrived here with the appropriate paperwork, and professionally. The number who are looking at deportation is about as small as the New Zealand First caucus, from what I can see. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Ron </strong><strong>Mark</strong>: I seek the leave of the House to table a document entitled "Weekly fraud updates at Mumbai area office from 28 March to 8 July 2016". The date of this document is 20 October 2016; the source is from an OIA request to Immigration New Zealand.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that particular document. Any objection? There is objection.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Gerry </strong><strong>Brownlee</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. It might be a better course of action for the member to table the entire OIA response, which, of course, is a document that proves to him that the New Zealand Government is on top of this particular problem, and it would save the House a lot of time.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! [<em>Interruption</em>] I do not need assistance from either member. That is not a point of order. It would certainly be more helpful than tabling documents after every supplementary question—which he is doing, in my mind, more to strengthen the political point he has made in his question, which is not the purpose of tabling a document. I have started putting the leave. If there are many more, it would be better, I think, if we hold it until the end and we put them all in one go, if I decide that they are relevant. But I do point out that the basic function of tabling a document is to provide further information to members. Everything that has been tabled so far by leave of the House has actually already been announced in the supplementary question that the member has given to the Prime Minister, so it is not adding any further information to members. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Ron </strong><strong>Mark</strong>: Oh, it is.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I am on my feet, Mr Mark. It is not providing any further information. It may be reinforcing the information the member is making in his supplementary question, but that is not the point of tabling a document.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Ron </strong><strong>Mark</strong>: Speaking to your point—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: No, there is no need to speak to the point. I have made a decision. Does the member have a further supplementary—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Ron </strong><strong>Mark</strong>: I seek leave to make a clarifying statement, because what you have just impugned is my reputation.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! Leave is sought for the member to make a clarifying statement. Is there any objection? There is objection. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Annette </strong><strong>King</strong>: You don't object to personal statements. That's stupid, Gerry.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! It was not a personal statement the member was seeking to make.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Ron Mark</strong>: Is it not a fact that, despite the Prime Minister's assurances, fraud is rife in the Indian student market and it is affecting the reputation of our export education market, and yet he is too weak to raise the issue to the Indian Prime Minister's attention and/or even attempt to address the problem that is contained in these documents here?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Far from it—125,000-odd students came to New Zealand last year, and about 30,000 came from India. The number of students that have been identified in New Zealand who could be deported because there could be irregularity with their documentation is a very tiny, tiny fraction of that. It is not even in the hundreds, let alone the sort of number the member seems to be claiming. The system is clearly working, because we are picking up the issues. Actually, overall, this is an industry worth well over $3.5 billion to New Zealand, and it works well. We know that the member represents the party that does not want to engage with the rest of the world, but he not should keep his head in the sand.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Denis </strong><strong>O'Rourke</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Standing Order 386, "Content of replies", states: "(2) The reply to any question must be concise and confined to the subject-matter … and not contain … discreditable references to … any member of Parliament". This is not the first time the Prime Minister has made discreditable mentions of the New Zealand First caucus, which has got nothing to do with any of his questions.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! Can I remind—[<em>Interruption</em>] No, I do not need assistance. Can I ask the member, when he returns to his office, to have a look at Standing Order 380. It also mentions that the supplementary questions are to be concise, without opinion or epithet. [<em>Interruption</em>] Order! When the last question was asked, it referred to, effectively, saying that the Prime Minister was too weak. If a member asks a question like that, he will get a robust response.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Ron Mark</strong>: Noting those answers, Prime Minister, can you not understand how most New Zealanders will see that your failure to raise these issues and the serious matters contained in your own department's documents leaves this Government to be seen to be treating Indian students as cash cows and letting them be seen as being exploited, with our global reputation on human rights being brought into disrepute? Because that is the situation we are in, Prime Minister, all because you failed to raise—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! The general debate takes place after question time. I remind the member that supplementary questions must be concise.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Ron </strong><strong>Mark</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I have to say that I find that difficult to understand when I look at the answers and the length of the answers that you have consistently allowed your National Party colleagues—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! The member will resume his seat. The answer clearly relates to the question. If the question is long and full of opinion, like that question, it inevitably leads to a longer answer, and then we get a complaint from Mr O'Rourke about the length of the answer. If the member could practise his supplementary questions so that they are more in line with the Standing Orders—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Ron </strong><strong>Mark</strong>: You've been pandering to them all day.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! If the member wants to stay to enjoy the balance of question time, then he will not interject when I am on my feet.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Denis </strong><strong>O'Rourke</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Just before I call the member, I want to be absolutely clear. The member has raised a point of order. I have given a ruling both to Mr O'Rourke and to Mr Mark—and to the whole House. If the member intends to relitigate the answers that I have given, then I will deal with that very, very severely, and it may be that I ask the member to leave. I just want to make that clear. If the member is going to raise a fresh point of order, he is, of course, entitled to do so.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Denis </strong><strong>O'Rourke</strong>: This has nothing to do with a previous point of order. The point of order I raise, Mr Speaker, is that you said in your answer that I raised a matter relating to the length of the answers by the Prime Minister. I did no such thing. My point of order was about the content—concerning references to the New Zealand First caucus. It had nothing to do with the length, and I would ask you to withdraw that comment.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I appreciate that the member may not have heard it, but I said to the member that when a supplementary question puts in political points like "The Prime Minister is too weak to raise an issue.", then it is likely that you will get a very robust response back, as indeed has happened today. Question No. 3—</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN </strong><strong>KEY</strong>: I didn't answer the question.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The Prime Minister has pointed out that he has not had an opportunity to answer the question. I will ask the Prime Minister to answer the question.</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: No.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><h4 class="QSubjectheadingalone"><strong>Economy</strong><strong>—</strong><strong>Reports</strong></h4><p class="SubsQuestion"><strong>3. </strong><strong>DAVID BENNETT (National—Hamilton East</strong><strong>)</strong> to the <strong>Minister of </strong><strong>Finance</strong>: What reports has he received on the economy?</p><p class="SubsAnswer"><a name="time_20161102 14:34:03" ></a><strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH (Minister of Finance)</strong>: Earlier today Statistics New Zealand released its latest data on employment and wages. Unemployment has fallen to 4.9 percent, its lowest level since the global financial crisis, supported by a 1.4 percent lift in employment and a 1.2 percent lift in hours worked in the September quarter. In the last year, 144,000 jobs have been added to the economy. The labour force participation rate has reached 70.1 percent, which is the highest level in the 30-year history of the household labour force survey, and New Zealand's employment rate—that is, the proportion of the population in employment—is now the second-highest in the OECD.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>David Bennett</strong>: How are rising wages and low inflation putting more spending power in the pockets of New Zealand households?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: Statistics New Zealand reports that average weekly wages increased 1.9 percent in the last year, led by wage increases for nurses, primary school teachers, and the police. Over the same period, inflation was just 0.2 percent, which means real increases in New Zealanders' wages. This confirms that the economy is generating higher incomes and more jobs for families and households.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>David Bennett</strong>: How is broad-based economic growth helping to support regional growth?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: One aspect of the statistics that is particularly pleasing is the falling unemployment rate in many regions, particularly the West Coast, Manawatū, Whanganui, Northland, and the Waikato, with a number of regions having unemployment under 5 percent and some even under 4 percent—a testament to the excellent efforts of the Minister for Economic Development, the Hon Steven Joyce, as well as the resilience of our resource-based regional economies. There are some other aspects of the release that are positive. There are fewer unemployed women, down to 5.1 percent from 5.4 percent. The unemployment rate for Māori and Pasifika is still too high, but both have dropped by about 2 percent over the last year.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>David Bennett</strong>: What reports has he received showing how elevated business optimism is supporting a strong investment outlook for New Zealand?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: No one gets a job unless a business decides to take the risk of hiring a person, and employment does not go up unless they take the risk of hiring an extra person over and above the staff that they already have. The ANZ Business Outlook survey reports a net 38 percent of businesses are optimistic about their own prospects for the year ahead, and 21 percent of them are expecting to hire new staff. Importantly, a net 19 percent intend to invest. These expectations for more investment and more jobs are above the long-term average. Residential and commercial building intentions are particularly strong.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: Can the Minister confirm that today's release shows that there are 3,000 more actual people unemployed than there were at the start of the year?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: That may well be the case, but fortunately there are a lot more people in work, and for those who are not in work, there are two things going for them: one is that they are in one of the faster-growing economies in the developed world, so the opportunities are as good here as anywhere, and, secondly, for those who are not in work and are in the welfare system, the Government has in place a comprehensive process to support those people getting back into work.</p></div></body>

I think it does suggest that more funding is required to health generally and also mental health"; if not, who is out of touch, Professor Abbot or him?</p><p class="SubsAnswer"><a name="time_20161102 14:38:46" ></a><strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN (Minister of Health)</strong>: The only person who might be out of touch is any former Minister in a Government that ran up $160 million of deficits in 17 district health boards (DHBs) who now complains that a greatly reduced deficit of $60 million is out of control. As the member knows, health has remained the Government's No. 1 funding priority. That is why we have invested an extra $2.2 billion in health over the next 4 years for new initiatives and to meet cost pressures and population growth. This Government has also increased mental health and addiction services funding from $1.1 billion to over $1.4 billion.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: If Professor Abbott is wrong and half our DHBs are not in financial strife, how does he account for the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists' comments that all DHBs have a significant backlog of patients needing follow-up eye appointments, with as many as 7,000 in one DHB alone and—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! I remind the member that questions need to be concise.</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: Obviously, in ophthalmology there are one or two DHBs that need to lift their game, but you have got to place that against the background of greatly increasing demands. So, in terms of injections for glaucoma, the demand for those injections, because we have got this new technology, has increased by three to five times. But the background is that in ophthalmology we are doing a 100 percent uplift in operations and appointments compared with a number of years ago. So it is actually pretty good.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Can he confirm that the college had asked him for more resources for public hospital eye clinics, for training specialist nurses, and for more ophthalmologists in March 2015; if so, what action has he taken to address the disgraceful situation of Kiwis losing their sight through poor ministerial oversight?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Either of those two supplementary questions. </p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: I have not met a group of doctors in the whole time I have been involved with healthcare that has not wanted more resources. That is how it goes. But that letter I had from the ophthalmologists actually was focused more on them wanting more decision-making rights over prioritising patients. So there were a range of issues they were discussing. But, of course, people want more resources all the time, and the answer to that is there has actually been an extra $4.2 billion that has gone into the health sector over the last 8 years.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Did the Health and Disability Commissioner advise him that he had been made aware of the serious situation and unacceptable delays in eye treatment in the Southern District Health Board (Southern DHB) in mid-2015; if not, when did he become aware of the problem?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Again, either of those two supplementary questions.</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: I would have to check my notes.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Why did he require $10 million in efficiencies from Southern DHB in 2015-16 when it was running a $34 million deficit, was unable to treat serious eye conditions in a timely manner, and was struggling to keep up with orthopaedic surgery and doing fewer elective operations in 2015-16 than in 2008-09 under a Labour Budget?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: Look, I think the case of Southern DHB has been well canvassed. As you know, we sacked the district health board last year—a $42 million deficit down to $35 million this year and it is improving with a sustainable plan.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Why is he refusing to front up and be interviewed on the disastrous neglect of eye treatment around New Zealand—something the college did tell him about in March 2015, 18 months ago?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: Well, look, that is just completely incorrect. I have answered a number of questions from the media on that. I did a stand up outside in the lobby yesterday. So the member is actually misleading the House on that one.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order!</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Annette </strong><strong>King</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I take exception to that, and I could table, from Radio New Zealand, the refusal by that Minister to go on.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! [<em>Interruption</em>] Order! Speaker's ruling 47/4 is quite clear that you cannot say that another member is making things up. So I require Jonathan Coleman to stand and withdraw the last part of his answer.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN </strong><strong>COLEMAN</strong>: I withdraw and apologise.</p></div></body>

So it is not possible to answer the member's question as it is based on hypotheticals.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Dr Kennedy </strong><strong>Graham</strong>: I seek leave to table New Zealand's proposed accounting approach outlined in a Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) briefing dated 13 November 2015, received under the Official Information Act (OIA), to demonstrate that it is more than hypothetical.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I just need to check—is it freely available if members want it?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Dr Kennedy </strong><strong>Graham</strong>: No, it was obtained under the OIA.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: That does not actually answer my question. I will hear from the Hon Paula Bennett.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon PAULA </strong><strong>BENNETT</strong>: It is actually available on the UN website. We put it there in November last year.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Then in that case, I will not be putting the leave. Further supplementary questions?</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Dr Kennedy Graham</strong>: Does the Minister believe that her preferred approach for forestry accounting under the Paris Agreement—even if it is hypothetical in the sense that it has not been finalised—would have environmental integrity through a reduction in net emissions?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: It would depend on how we transition to it and what the rules and details are around it.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Dr Kennedy Graham</strong>: Does she accept, given the details in the MPI document, that the timing of this preferred accounting approach could mean that it appears that New Zealand's emissions would reduce despite no actual emission reductions taking place in the real world?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: I am told that the timing of them looking at it in 2020 is based purely on the Paris Agreement coming into force then and the new rules after Kyoto, not necessarily because it is in line with when we might have a whole lot of trees being cut down.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Dr Kennedy Graham</strong>: As a general judgment on her part, does she accept that if Governments reduce emissions on paper but not in the real world, where climate change affects real people and ecosystems, the real world will be significantly worse off?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: It is my judgment—and, actually, I have said publicly a number of times—that I am very interested in how New Zealand does reduce its emissions. It is part of the work that is going on now that we have got, through a variety of task force advisory groups, even some of the work that the member is involved in internationally as well—which is part of what we want to do to actually reach that 2030 target, as well as looking at forestry and planting more trees, and, equally, looking at international markets. So do I want to reduce emissions in New Zealand? Absolutely. </p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Dr Kennedy Graham</strong>: Does the Minister accept that the proposed rule changes in the MPI document, if accepted, would unjustifiably write off nearly a year's worth of greenhouse gas emissions from the Government's books?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: It would completely and utterly depend on how we would transition to it. As the report says, averaging is a worthwhile discussion to be having, and we are concerned that we want to see more trees being planted as they are being chopped down. At the moment there are disincentives for that, so we are looking at what we can do, and averaging is one way to get over that. There are other consequences of doing it, which I freely admit, and that is part of the work that is going on at the moment. Decisions have not been made.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Dr Kennedy Graham</strong>: Would she be concerned about the possibility that other countries, including bigger emitters, would follow New Zealand's example and simply change the rules of the game so that they can avoid doing something about climate change themselves as well?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: I am certainly advised by the officials who are working internationally and who are looking at the Paris Agreement rules, now that we have got them in place, that a number of countries are looking at exactly what we are looking at, and it is what they need to do. So we are looking domestically, through phase 2 of the emissions trading scheme, and we are also looking at what the rules of engagement, if you like, will be now that the Paris Agreement has been signed and ratified.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Dr Kennedy Graham</strong>: If the Government were to succeed in getting these preferred rules accepted and then implemented the proposed accounting rules, would it make its 2030 climate change more ambitious in order to compensate?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: It would depend, as I have said, on what those rules end up being and on what the transition is, but certainly all of that will be made transparent and, I am sure, will be openly debated.</p></div></body>

As part of the ongoing overseas-based borrower compliance campaign, last week the first data-match under the information-sharing agreement with the Australian Taxation Office was made, locating contact information for around 10,400 student loan borrowers living in Australia. With more than 90 percent of loans in default held by borrowers living overseas and a significant majority of those believed to be in Australia, this tool will be a huge boost to enable the Inland Revenue Department to get in touch with borrowers who have been hard to track down and those who are deliberately avoiding their obligations.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Sarah Dowie</strong>: What results is the compliance campaign delivering?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE</strong>: The campaign has achieved good results over the last year, including a 32 percent increase in repayments from defaulting borrowers and an additional $100 million being collected in the year, with collection overall through the campaign passing $300 million since it began. I expect that this initial information-sharing agreement will see a further improvement in that figure over the next year. What is more pleasing is that the Inland Revenue Department is reporting a turn-around in attitudes amongst overseas-based borrowers who have previously been reluctant to engage with the department. It seems to now be getting through that if you leave the country for a few years, you cannot leave your student loan behind and hope it goes away.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Sarah Dowie</strong>: Why is the Government encouraging overseas-based borrowers to meet their obligations?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE</strong>: Overseas-based borrowers are just 15.2 percent of student loan borrowers, but they represent more than 91 percent of the total amount of debt in default. So if those who stay in New Zealand can pay, it is important that those overseas also meet their obligation to taxpayers, who have supported their study, and allow the same level of support to be available for the next generation of students. It is important for borrowers to know that being overseas does not mean the loan goes away, and they are encouraged to get in touch and get on top of their loans. To assist with this, we have made it easier for borrowers to contact the Inland Revenue Department and easier for them to make payments from overseas.</p></div></body>

As I told the member yesterday, this has not delayed our target date for the legislation to be enacted, which is by far the more relevant date. In answer to the second part of the member's question, the compliance costs involved in net present value terms have been assessed as being up to $1.6 billion over 10 years.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: Can she confirm the official advice that she has received, that of the $1.6 billion of criminal funds being laundered in New Zealand 56 percent involves the purchase of real estate, and 26 percent involves the work of accountants and lawyers, the three groups that are the focus of phase two of the reforms?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon AMY ADAMS</strong>: With the information in front of me in the House, no, I cannot. But that could well be right. We certainly know that lawyers, accountants, and real estate agents are the sectors identified by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and our own financial intelligence unit as being sectors to be covered, which is why we have committed to them being covered in phase two of the reforms.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Grant </strong><strong>Robertson</strong>: I seek leave of the House to table a Ministry of Justice briefing note from July 2015 entitled "Phase 2 of the Anti-money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Reforms", which has those figures I had in my question.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that particular document. Is there any objection? There is none.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: Why did she reject the advice of officials in June 2015 to immediately begin policy work on implementing phase two of the reforms?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon AMY ADAMS</strong>: Actually, in July 2015 I announced that we were starting the initial scoping work of the reforms, and the advice of officials actually had us on a time frame of the legislation being enacted in late 2018. We are now committed to having it in place significantly before that.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: Why, 3 years after phase one was brought into force, 2 years after the Government was warned by President Xi of corrupt money from China entering New Zealand, and a year after officials asked her to begin work immediately is she still standing by, allowing billions of dollars of corrupt money to come into Nrew Zealand?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon AMY ADAMS</strong>: Far from standing by, this Government is getting on with ensuring the regime is in place as fast as possible, and, actually, faster than officials recommended. But I reiterate that $1.6 billion of compliance costs over 10 years is significant, and the fact that this Government cares about things like compliance costs and their impact on business is why we are the No. 1 country in the world for ease of doing business, and a big part of the reason unemployment has now dropped to 4.9 percent.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: Is not the real threat to mums and dads that hundreds of millions of dollars of criminal funds are being laundered in New Zealand through the real estate market, which is leading to massive house price increases and locking first-home buyers out of the housing market?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon AMY ADAMS</strong>: The member is blithely ignoring the fact that we already have the entire financial sector, which almost all real estate transactions go through, covered, and I think that if you asked ordinary New Zealanders whether they were worried about $1.6 billion of compliance costs landing on them, they would be very concerned and they would want the Government to proceed carefully.</p></div></body>

We have also brought in free visits for children under the age of 13, with over 780,000 children benefiting from free doctors visits and prescriptions. The numbers of prescriptions dispensed has increased by 23.9 percent, showing that the removal of costs has improved access to medicines. And, of course, fewer children under the age of 13 are presenting to emergency departments, which shows that these investments are all paying off.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Dr Shane </strong><strong>Reti</strong>: What specific services is the Government delivering to address serious but preventable diseases such as rheumatic fever?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: Reducing rheumatic fever rates is one of our Better Public Services targets, and recent figures show a 37 percent decrease in new cases. Although we are tracking in the right direction, it is an ambitious target, and we need to continue to do more. This week my colleague Anne Tolley and I announced an awareness campaign to recruit and train around a hundred young people, mainly Māori and Pasifika aged between 11 and 19, to talk about how we prevent rheumatic fever. The youth campaign is part of the $65 million the Government has invested in the fight against rheumatic fever.</p></div></body>

The Ministry of Social Development has been working closely with the Privacy Commissioner and the Government Chief Privacy Officer to ensure that clients' privacy rights are protected. It does the member no service, nor the people accessing these services, to create unfounded fears.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Jan </strong><strong>Logie</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.

I believe this member is simply scaremongering.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Jan Logie</strong>: Does the Minister not understand that the trust and confidentiality at the heart of social work, budgeting, and counselling will be undermined by requiring community organisations to hand over individuals' data to Government?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon JO GOODHEW</strong>: I absolutely reject that.

The recent Auckland—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Annette </strong><strong>King</strong>: What about the bridges? Are they on time?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon SIMON </strong><strong>BRIDGES</strong>: —well, just wait—Transport Alignment Project that the Government and Auckland jointly undertook shows that some form of rapid transit, whether it is bus or light rail, will be required on the Auckland isthmus between 2028 and 2038. Officials are currently looking into the best options. So it is important that officials do this work before politicians leap in, because, as we have seen with Labour and internationally recently, light-rail projects are highly susceptible to multibillion-dollar cost blowouts.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Has an actual business case been done on the Prime Minister's suggestion that fast buses be used instead of light rail, or is this just another example of the Government's stream of consciousness approach to dealing with chronic congestion in Auckland, which is costing the city billions of dollars in lost productivity?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon SIMON BRIDGES</strong>: No, that is the point here: no business case has been done on anything, and that is why it was so stupid to make a $700 million promise that overnight became $1,400 million, and may well be $2 billion before they are finished. [<em>Interruption</em>] </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! I do not need the assistance from members to my far right. [<em>Interruption</em>] Order! David Bennett. Order! Mr Bennett might think it is a joke; I am quite serious. Members have a right to ask a question, and if the members are delayed from asking that question and not given the opportunity to hold the Government to account, that is a serious matter. If I need to ask somebody from that quarter to be leaving the House to get some control, I will not hesitate to do so.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Does he agree with the Auckland central access plan that investing in more buses would cost $9.5 billion and generate safety concerns, while light rail would cost less than half that and improve safety and travel time reliability; or does he support Parmjeet Parmar's plan to fix congestion by building more bus stops?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon SIMON BRIDGES</strong>: Those figures sound highly inflated. I think the point of all of this is for us to have officials and experts actually go away and analyse the options before we make promises that go from hundreds of million to billions, without any sense of what the true costs and the benefits of it all are.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Will he confirm that in the negotiations on the Auckland Transport Alignment Project, the council wanted light rail in the first decade, but he and Bill English insisted on pushing it back so it would not happen until after 2028?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon SIMON BRIDGES</strong>: What I confirm is that unlike the way the Labour Party may have acted when it was in office, there was no political interference. This was a process that was about officials and experts working through this rationally and on the basis of evidence, and they came out with 2028 to 2038. On this side of the House we work through the evidence before we make promises.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Marama Fox</strong>: Will the Minister look into a study to rejoin the Wairoa to Gisborne rail link, providing vital infrastructure to the region?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: It is a fair way from the original question, but I will give the Minister a chance.</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon SIMON BRIDGES</strong>: Oh—let us see what happens.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Why does his Government keep playing politics with Auckland transport when, according to the Ministry of Transport, delays in the average morning commute have gone up by 25 percent since 2012?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon SIMON BRIDGES</strong>: Here is what I call playing politics: making a $700 million promise that overnight becomes $1,400 million, without any evidence, without any benefit-cost ratio—basically, on the back of the envelope stuff. That is what I call playing pork-barrel politics.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Can he confirm that National is taking its typical five-step approach to Auckland transport: one, trash the project; two, let several years go by; three, blame others for the problem; four, let more years go by; five, belatedly admit that Labour's policy was right all along.</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon SIMON BRIDGES</strong>: What I can confirm is that the Government and Auckland have the best relationship in regard to transport that they have had in a very long time. That is because we have joined together, we have done the analysis, and we are investing billions of dollars. We have an indicative plan to spend a further $24 billion over the next decade in an integrated way—roading, public transport of a variety of forms. We are a strong Government in infrastructure that is making a real difference when it comes to transportation in Auckland.</p></div></body>

This is a mobile drug-detection device, which uses a laser to analyse the substance, often without needing to open the packaging. The device was purchased with over a million dollars from funding from the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act, so Customs' hard work in seizing drugs and catching criminals has paid off. We are using assets taken from the criminals to purchase tools that will help seize more drugs and catch more criminals.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Mark Mitchell</strong>: How will these devices enhance Customs' capabilities to protect the border?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon NICKY WAGNER</strong>: The FirstDefenders will be vital equipment for our front-line officers, making drug detection quicker, safer, and more efficient. They are portable, they are easy to use, and the samples are matched against the database of 11,000 illegal substances to prove an accurate match within seconds, without having to go to the lab. Customs will share this latest capability with partner agencies to help broader drug-enforcement work.</p><p class="SupQuestion"><strong>Mark Mitchell</strong>: What reports has she received on Customs' recent meth interceptions at the border?</p><p class="SupAnswer"><strong>Hon NICKY WAGNER</strong>: Customs' largest ever meth seizure was announced last week. It was $176 million of meth seized from shipping containers in July, after a 16-month investigation.

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 15:15:01" ></a><strong>Hon DAVID PARKER (Labour)</strong>: I move, <em>That the House take note of a matter of urgent public importance</em>. The only positive for the Hon Murray McCully in this report is that the report finds that he is not guilty of the crime of corruption. No money went into his hands, and he has been found not to have bribed anyone else. Beyond that, this report is an absolute indictment of the Government, its cover-up, and its poor standards. Indeed, the Auditor-General is very, very clear in distancing herself from the immorality—I do not say the morality; I say the immorality—of what has gone down here, and she says the use of a contract for services to resolve these matters was a decision made by Cabinet. </p><p class="a">I comment below on the quality of the Cabinet paper process, not on the decision itself. The Government will turn up today, as it did with Skycity, and say that this report exonerates it. It does not. It lays bare an absolutely disgraceful stain upon the record of New Zealand. The Government has acted immorally, improperly, wasted millions of dollars, covered it up, lied to the Parliament, and lied to the public. It is only because of the very good services of a couple of journalists in particular that this even came to light. </p><p class="a">This shabby sheep deal in the desert was exposed only because two journalists chased it down. The first was Matthew Hooton. Matthew Hooton ran a number of articles in the <em>National Business Review</em> saying that this was a shady deal that did not make sense. The only thing he knew about at the time was the then said to be $6 million cost of a farm in the desert, which was meant to be some demonstration farm of New Zealand agricultural expertise. He said it never made sense, he postulated that it was linked to trying to get a free-trade agreement with Saudi Arabia—an issue that the Government denied—and he kept digging and poking away at it. The National Government pretended there was nothing wrong. </p><p class="a">Heather du Plessis-Allan, then at TV ONE, did an absolutely fantastic job of breaking this story. She ran a number of news items on TV ONE, she raised the question as to whether this was all as it seemed, and she put in a number of Official Information Act requests. She also approached me. I smelled a rat there. I do not normally fish in Parliament; I normally come with things that I can prove. But I came fishing, and on the day I came fishing with regards to payments in addition to the $6 million payment, McCully stood up on the tiles and told Heather du Plessis-Allan: "Oh, by the way, there's another $4 million cash payment that we haven't told you about." </p><p class="a">I came to this House and I asked questions about that $4 million cash payment, and Minister McCully stood up in this House and pretended that that $4 million payment was necessary, (1) to settle a legal risk, and (2) to pay for intellectual property. He denied that it was to facilitate a free-trade agreement with Saudi Arabia. He blamed the prior Labour Government. He blamed the prior Labour Government, and he said that I should be ashamed of myself for being part of that Government and that Phil Goff should be ashamed of himself for causing that $4 million payment to Mr Al Khalaf. That is what he told this Parliament, and that is what he told journalists. </p><p class="a">The Labour Party sought release of our Cabinet papers from the last Government relating to the extension of the ban on the export of live sheep to Saudi Arabia for slaughter, because Mr McCully and the National Government were saying that there was evidence in them to back up his assertion that it was our fault and that he was paying off a legal claim that we had created. The National Government then actively supressed the release of those papers and breached the very Cabinet convention that is meant to act for the preservation of the national interest. </p><p class="a">After weeks of the Government pretending that we could not see the full amount of those Cabinet papers, disclosing to the media redacted copies of them, and pretending that in the redacted parts there was evidence of some poor practice by the Labour Government, I released them, because the Government was in breach of that convention, and proved that those allegations that it was us who had somehow created a legal risk were wrong. </p><p class="a">Of course, it was always legitimate for the past Government to ban the export of live sheep for slaughter. We now all know that that was initially because of the death of sheep in transit and that some of those processes have improved substantially, but that it was expanded or extended because of the evidence that was on TV about inhumane practices in Saudi Arabia after those sheep landed, when they were slaughtered in very inhumane ways that would not be allowed if they were slaughtered in New Zealand before they were shipped as carcasses.</p><p class="a">Those practices included stuffing them in boots, tying them up, and cutting the tendons of their legs so that they could not run away. There was great justification for the then Minister of Agriculture under the Labour Government to extend that ban on the export of live sheep for slaughter, and the current Government, under the then Minister of Agriculture, acted entirely appropriately when the National Government itself again extended the ban on the export of live sheep for slaughter, not once but twice. Each time it did it, it acted legally. Therefore, it was always a fiction that there was a legal claim faced by the Government that justified the $4 million cash payment.</p><p class="a">What has the Auditor-General said? And if I have got time, I am also going to take the House through some of the papers. The Auditor-General said "I share many New Zealanders' concerns about the arrangements. I found significant shortcomings in the paper put to Cabinet in support of the decision to enter into the Saudi Arabia Food Security Partnership." on page 5. Again, on page 5: "In my view, settlement of a grievance was provided under the guise of a contract for services." "Guise"—i.e., a disguised payment, which was to facilitate a free-trade agreement and to settle these grievances of Sheikh Al Ali Khalaf, which had no basis in law. Then she goes on to say: "Importantly, the contract does not specifically reflect the settlement component relating to the grievance."</p><p class="a">That has been one of our points all along—that these documents misrepresented the true position. The Minister has denied it. He has been found out, and if we have now reached the point in New Zealand where the standard of conduct expected of Ministers is so low that they have to be found to be guilty of a crime before they are forced to resign, that is a terrible state of affairs in New Zealand—a terrible state for New Zealand—because what is the truth at the heart of this is that the incompetence of the Minister has been shown up. We still do not have the free-trade agreement. The incompetence of the Minister has been shown up. Many millions of dollars have been wasted on a farm in the desert. The lambs died. Rather than showcasing New Zealand's expertise, that has sullied our reputation. What else has he done? Well, of course, he has covered that up, as I have already addressed, and he has misled Parliament and the public. </p><p class="a">The contract for services was intended to conceal the nature of the arrangement. That is what we have said, and that was what is imprudent. What does the Auditor-General say further? And I am only up to page 5: "This lack of transparency, both at the time of the decision and subsequently, has led to the concerns from the New Zealand public about the nature of the payments made. To date, explanations from Ministers or officials have not resolved those public concerns." That is quite true. In fact, until now, they have actively tried to cover up the true nature of these transactions.</p><p class="a">Then, as I have already said, the Auditor-General says: "The use of a contract for services to resolve these matters was a decision made by Cabinet. I comment … on the quality of the Cabinet paper process but not on the decision itself." She is making no comment on the morality of paying off a disaffected multimillionaire Saudi sheikh—millions of dollars in order to facilitate a free-trade agreement with Saudi Arabia. The Labour Party is willing to make that call. That is unprincipled and wrong. It is not something that the New Zealand Government should do. </p><p class="a">The Auditor-General then says: "I found some significant shortcomings in the Cabinet paper, including that it: did not clearly explain that the Al Khalaf Group would own the goods and services costing the New Zealand Government $6 million;"—it is a bit of a miss, is it not, Mr McCully? It "did not identify how the $10 million"—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Grant </strong><strong>Robertson</strong>: Making it up.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon DAVID </strong><strong>PARKER</strong>: That was the $10 million in addition to the $4 million—sorry, the $10 million figure was made up. It was a figure that rose to $11.5 million. We actually know that that $11.5 million included flying sheep on Singapore Airlines to the other side of the world, to a farm in the desert where most of the lambs died, and it was meant to be a model farm of New Zealand practice. </p><p class="a">She also says that the Cabinet paper "signalled the risk of a claim against the Government based only on the $20-$30 million figure that the Cabinet paper said was suggested by the Al Khalaf Group (there was no assessment by Ministry officials of the substance of that legal risk);". I and the media have been fighting for a year—a year—to prove that point, and the Minister has resisted every attempt. I have got, under the Official Information Act, notes where the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) was schooled on the obfuscatory answers he was to give at the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee to deny that. The Government dragged the ministry into this cover-up as well. </p><p class="a">The Auditor-General says further: "I was surprised that it was decided to use a contract with a private individual's business interests to resolve a diplomatic issue between governments. It is difficult to reconcile the words of the contract with the unstated objectives,"—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Grant </strong><strong>Robertson</strong>: That's right. That's the cover-up.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon DAVID </strong><strong>PARKER</strong>: It is the cover-up. Then the Auditor-General ends by saying, look, we are not a corrupt country, but transparency must be assured in order to avoid us being a more corrupt country. </p><p class="a">Two other points. The report does not consider how it was that McCully got his old mate Alex Matheson—who worked for him way back when and was working for the Ministry of Economic Development overseas and somehow came to be working for the Rugby World Cup for McCully, then, at the end of that road, somehow he was appointed by McCully as a sort of roving consular figure in the Middle East—to sew up this deal. He was his inside man, who sewed this up. How is it that MFAT allows itself to be so manipulated by its Minister that it allowed that to happen? There was no consideration of how Michelle Boag, the former president of the National Party, somehow inveigled herself into the deal. </p><p class="a">This is, I think, a disgraceful episode. I personally feel misled by Mr McCully. I have never said that he took a cheque or that he had profited financially. I think it is a very, very narrow view of what is right and wrong if he is judged by anyone on the basis of whether he breached the Crimes Act in terms of corruption. The truth is that this was a disreputable waste of money, which has been covered up for a long, long time, and it would not have come to the attention of the public had it not been for Matthew Hooton and Heather du Plessis-Allan, whom I think we should be celebrating as actually having done very good investigative work on this occasion. </p><p class="a">Can I also thank the Speaker for enabling the House to actually bring this to a head in a way that caused the Auditor-General's inquiry. If it had not been for the thorough processes that we have around question time, again, the Government would have avoided responsibility for wasting $11.5 million of taxpayer money, including a $4 million cash payment to Mr Al Khalaf. </p><p class="a">We know it was a compensatory payment, because there are other papers, which we finally got under the Official Information Act, that showed that Mr Khalaf's representative, Mr George Assaf, said that they needed compensation. Why would a Government ever think that you should buy your way into a free-trade agreement with someone who is connected in Saudi Arabia—with the then Minister of Agriculture getting out of the way—and, effectively, pay him off because of his grievance, which was not substantial in law, in order to get a free-trade agreement with the Gulf states?</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 15:30:03" ></a><strong>Hon MURRAY </strong><strong>McCULLY</strong><strong> (Minister of Foreign Affairs)</strong>: I want to take the opportunity today to make some brief remarks in relation to the release of the Auditor-General's report today. To those members of the public who listened to the contribution by Mr Parker and who feel confused, can I simply say to them that they should read the report. I cannot do justice to it in a few remarks in the House today; I will just make a few points. I do say to those who are concerned about this matter: read the full report. The best bits were not, in fact, quoted to the House today by Mr Parker.</p><p class="a">It is an important report, and I welcome it because I was on the receiving end of some very colourful allegations by Mr Parker and by some of his fellow travellers, who decided to use words like "bribery", "corruption", "facilitation payments", "dodgy", etc., to describe a genuine attempt by the Government and by senior ministry officials, led by myself, to deal with a situation that we inherited. This is not a situation that the National-led Government created for itself; it was a situation that we inherited from our predecessors. Mr Parker can obfuscate all he likes, but anyone who reads the Auditor-General's report can draw their own reasonable conclusions about the situation that was inherited by me, by my then colleague Tim Groser, and by members of this Government.</p><p class="a">The first reason that I am pleased to welcome this report today is that the allegations of bribery and corruption made by Mr Parker and others—very serious allegations to make in a constitutional democracy like New Zealand—have been shown to be completely baseless. After full cooperation from members of the Government, members of the New Zealand Public Service, and all parties involved in this interesting period of recent history, the Auditor-General has said very clearly, and I quote from page 54, "We found no evidence of corruption, bribery, or a facilitation payment … The arrangements entered into were a lawful use of public resources, and public money was spent with appropriate financial authorities in place." That is exactly what the Auditor—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Grant </strong><strong>Robertson</strong>: Read the next paragraph—read the next paragraph.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon MURRAY </strong><strong>McCULLY</strong>: I am going to talk about the next paragraph. The Auditor-General has made a full-frontal finding that the very colourful, defamatory accusations being made by some members of this House are simply baseless and false.</p><p class="a">Can I say that nobody listening to this debate should be surprised by that. This was not a process that was conducted by three or four people in a dark room; this was a process that involved months and months of discussion, involving the most senior officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade—senior officials from the Middle East and Africa division, senior officials from the trade division, the most senior legal people available to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and, indeed, external legal advice on aspects as well. It should come as no surprise to anyone that there is a full-frontal finding by the Auditor-General today that there was no bribery, that there was no corruption, that there was no facilitation payment, that there was a set of arrangements that were "a lawful use of public resources", and that "public money was spent with appropriate financial authorities in place."</p><p class="a">I want just to go back to the Cabinet paper that has been the subject of some comment by the Auditor-General—and I will make some references to that in a minute—and just read the first paragraph, because it is important to remember the history: "This paper updates Ministers on progress in resolving a serious bilateral relationship issue with Saudi Arabia that poses a major threat to New Zealand's trade and economic interests." For the past 4 years this issue has spilled over into the wider Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and has been asserted by the GCC to be the only obstacle to ratification of the New Zealand - GCC free-trade agreement (FTA). This was an FTA that was fully negotiated—completely negotiated—by negotiators on both sides, and the Saudi Government put in place a block on further interaction, because of offence that had been caused by the history, which I invite members who are interested to read in the Auditor-General's report.</p><p class="a">It is true—and I am going to be more even-handed than Mr Parker and concede—that there are some areas of this history that the Auditor-General gives the Government less than approval for. The report does suggest that some aspects of this process were less than perfect. It describes, first of all, the use of a contract for services as "problematic". Can I say to the House today that I agree with that—I agree with that. In fact, what I would also say is that there were simply no non-problematic responses available to the Government. It is notable that the Auditor-General makes no suggestion as to what a non-problematic course of action available to the Government might have been. Can I be quite clear that the course of action that could easily have ensued, one of simply letting matters fester even further, would have been even more problematic to the Government, more problematic to New Zealand, and more problematic to our long-term trade and economic interests. That is why members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and I took the steps that are outlined carefully in this report.</p><p class="a">As Mr Parker has told the House, there is a comment in the report that suggests that additional analysis should have been provided in the Cabinet paper that went to the Cabinet committee and to Cabinet. I want to say, first and foremost, that I am not going to comment on those findings of the Auditor-General. It seems to me to defeat the whole purpose of having as independent an exercise as this if people are simply going to give it their own analysis and spin. I just want to say, to the extent that there are matters that the Auditor-General suggests could have been undertaken better, and to the extent that there are procedures or processes that could have been improved, that as the Minister responsible, I will that take on the chin. I believe that we did our best in some very difficult and some very trying circumstances. To the extent that there were some blemishes in the process along the way, they have been identified by the Auditor-General, and those comments should be treated with respect, and I certainly will do so.</p><p class="a">The most important point that I want to make to the House today is that the objective that the Government set in embarking upon these proceedings has been substantially achieved. I would refer to a press release here, which was released by my colleague the Minister of Trade on 29 September in the course of a visit to Saudi Arabia, which is headed "New Zealand &amp; Saudi seek early completion of GCC FTA", and accompanying this statement is a joint statement signed by Minister Todd McClay and by the Saudi Arabian Minister of Commerce, jointly committing the two Governments to the early completion of the GCC FTA. That visit followed one that I myself had undertaken earlier, and it follows interactions I have had with each of the other five Governments of the Gulf States to confirm that in this matter, having been resolved to the satisfaction of the Saudi parties, and particularly to the satisfaction of the Saudi Government, the objection has been removed and the issue of the free-trade agreement is now back on the rails and will take its proper course.</p><p class="a">Those who do not take an interest in these matters may be surprised to hear that this is a very important market to New Zealand producers today. This is going to be a much more important market to New Zealand in the coming years, not just because the Gulf States themselves are hugely important, not just because they are natural partners—in that they have significant funds but a significant lack of arable land and water, and that their No. 1 priority is food security—but also because this is the gateway to the African continent, where there is going to be an explosion of trade and economic opportunity for New Zealand business in the years to come. For any New Zealand Government simply to walk away from a frozen free-trade agreement negotiation because it was difficult to resolve would not have been a responsible course of action. It was not one that I was prepared to contemplate.</p><p class="a">So to the extent that there are criticisms of the process that are levelled in the Auditor-General's report today, I accept those criticisms as the Minister responsible. To the extent that there is credit, now or in future, that is to be distributed as New Zealand banks the gains that come from the completion of the free-trade agreement and the enhancement of economic and trade opportunities with the Middle East and with Africa, I hope that some of that credit will come my way as well.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 15:41:20" ></a><strong>JAMES SHAW (Co-Leader—Green)</strong>: Something maybe legal, but that does not mean it is not dodgy, and that does not mean it is not unprincipled. In other words, being found not guilty is not the same as being innocent. It is a bit like investing in cluster munitions through a distant legal mechanism. That is legal, but it does not make it right. I am pleased that the Minister of Foreign Affairs has chosen to front in the House today, to this report. It has been a long time coming. David Parker and I wrote to the Auditor-General on 28 May last year, so this report has been 18 months in coming. It finds that no laws were broken, but it also finds that there is a litany of incompetence, of unprincipled and rogue behaviour, of a cavalier approach to the use of public funds, and a complete lack of transparency. As David Parker said in his opening remarks in this debate, surely we have higher standards for our Ministers than merely not being crooks. Surely we hold them to standards of competence, that they observe due process, and that they are transparent, and that they use public funds wisely. It is quite an extraordinary picture that has emerged through this report. I want to pick up on a few specific points within the report. </p><p class="a">First of all, the Auditor-General finds that the contract for services was used to transfer value to the Al-Khalaf Group in order to (a) settle a grievance and a very vague claim for compensation—this is on page 8—and (b) to resolve a diplomatic issue that was perceived to stand in the way of a trade deal, as outlined on page 9. There does not seem to have been a clear finding as to why compensation was dressed up as services. The Auditor-General refers to this, on page 9, as "a convenient mechanism" and that Mr McCully thought that compensation would need to be scrutinised by "a plethora of lawyers and bureaucrats" and so he wanted to avoid it. This is on page 32 of the report. Because of this guise, there was no analysis of the risk of a legal claim. There was not a clear explanation to Cabinet of what was going on. The contract does not contain any settlement wording at all. The Auditor-General refers to these as "significant shortcomings". She says that they are surprising, and this is a failure to be transparent. It is worse, I think, that a Minister is using a sham device to avoid proper process and scrutiny. </p><p class="a">There are some specific quotes that I would like to pull out. The Auditor-General says: "I was surprised that it was decided to use a contract with a private individual's business interests to resolve a diplomatic issue between governments." I am just going to restate that. It is quite an extraordinary statement: "… it was decided to use a contract with a private individual's business interests to resolve a diplomatic issue between governments." She goes on to say: "It is difficult to reconcile the words of the contract with the unstated objectives, which included resolving a complex diplomatic issue and removing a perceived obstacle to the signing of the free trade agreement. The contract for services was a convenient mechanism by which the allocated $10 million, later $11.5 million, was put towards achieving those unstated objectives. It does not tell the full story." </p><p class="a">That is an extraordinary statement about the behaviour of any Minister of the Crown, operating on behalf of the Government of New Zealand, in our relations with private individuals and Governments overseas, and it is absolutely intolerable, on behalf of the New Zealand Government. An amount of $4 million was paid to a Saudi businessman because he asked for it. The Cabinet paper signalled that the risk of the claim was based only on the $20 million to $30 million that the Cabinet paper said was suggested by the Al-Khalaf Group itself. No one who was qualified to do so appeared to have considered whether the legal risk that Mr Key and Mr McCully used in this House to justify the payment was at all legitimate. Nobody tested that. The payment was based on the unqualified assertions made by Mr McCully. </p><p class="a">The Auditor-General goes on to say that in the Cabinet paper there is the promised $3 billion worth of trade in 5 years with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, and that there is no evidence for this claim in the Cabinet paper. There is simply an assertion. The Auditor-General has not been able to find any evidence to back up that claim anywhere else. No one has tested Mr Al Khalaf or the Gulf Cooperation Council's claims that this was the one thing that was standing in the way of the free-trade agreement. That, to me, is extraordinary; it is utterly extraordinary. This is based on absolute hearsay. The fact that the free-trade agreement is still not signed suggests that it was not the only block. The report also says that Treasury was supposed to have oversight of the project, and there does not yet seem to be any evidence that it did. </p><p class="a">At the very least this is clear incompetence. An amount of $8.7 million of public money has been spent, against a budget of $11.5 million. The report says that it is not clear on what basis those amounts paid were arrived at. These numbers just seem to have been plucked out of the air, in the Cabinet paper. In terms of competence, who thought that shipping South Island ewes to the middle of a Saudi desert was a good idea? Is anybody surprised that 75 percent of the lambs that were born there subsequently died? The report also says that there is a total lack of transparency. The Auditor-General says that the contract does not tell the full story, and that to date, even at the date of the publication of this report, Ministers and officials have not resolved those concerns about the lack of transparency. </p><p class="a">Although Mr McCully and the Prime Minister and others will stand up and say that this report somehow fully vindicates their behaviour, on the basis that no laws were broken, the behaviour exhibited, led by Mr McCully, is clearly incompetent, unprincipled, rogue behaviour. It is not transparent. I have to say that it is extraordinary to me that he continues on in his role as a Government Minister. I think that is intolerable and he should stand down immediately. The Prime Minister says that this was a creative solution. Well, I have to say that I started my career in one of the world's largest accounting firms and we referred to "creative accounting" as things to be avoided at all costs, because that is not the basis of a society or a Government on the rule of law, and we have higher standards for the behaviour of our Government than that. Mr McCully needs to go. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 15:50:12" ></a><strong>RICHARD PROSSER (NZ First)</strong>: Well, I am glad we have had this opportunity to debate this matter today. It has been a long time coming. In the short time that they have had it available to them, the media have had a chance to look at this report from the Auditor-General, and I think the headline that I have got in front of me pretty much sums it up. It says " 'Shortcomings' but no corruption in sheep deal—Auditor-General". </p><p class="a">That behoves us to ask the question: what is corruption? We have heard—the Minister has said and members have made comment—that corruption is something that in this case, if it went to court, legally, the people who have had the finger pointed at them would probably get off. But it goes beyond that, because if they are significant shortcomings, and if an issue like this does not pass the public-interest test—if it does not pass the "Will this make the front page of the <em>Dominion Post</em>?" test—if it is corruption of thought, if it is corruption of behaviour, if it is corruption of morals, and if it is corruption of the established, ethical ways of doing business, is that still corruption and is that something that we want to countenance? Is it something that we want to allow this nation and this Government to simply get away with because that is a way of, effectively, covering something up? </p><p class="a">There is an awful lot that has been said in a very short hurry about this, and I think many of us probably have not had a great deal of time to digest it in detail, but when there are statements that are made by someone of such unimpeachable integrity as the Auditor-General—when that person says "I was surprised that it was decided to use a contract with a private individual's business interests to resolve a diplomatic issue between governments.", that is something that we have to take on board and we have to take very seriously, because, in the grand scheme of things, resolving diplomatic issues between Governments is not something that is done, on the face of it, by the payment of money between Governments and private business individuals. When we boil all this down to brass tacks, essentially, that is what that comes down to. </p><p class="a">What this Government wanted was a free-trade deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council, and what was standing in the way of it was a Saudi businessman who was annoyed—understandably, perhaps, from his point of view—at losing lots and lots of money from the ending of the live animal trade from New Zealand, which we as a sovereign nation put a stop to on ethical grounds because of the conditions faced by livestock as they were transported from this side of the world to the other. That all came about when something like 5,000 sheep died on a ship on the way from Australia to the Middle East, and fingers can be pointed in all sorts of directions as to who or what was ultimately to blame for that. But it threw a spotlight on a trade where tens of thousands of animals were being transported from what we like to think of as being civilised places for slaughter to places that are quite frequently accused of being uncivilised places for slaughter, and the conditions in which they were transported gave measure to that lack of civilisation, never mind what happened at the other end when they arrived. </p><p class="a">We had put a stop to it. Money was lost. People, obviously, at the other end of that deal were experiencing much chagrin at losing money and they brought political and financial influence to bear on the political system at their end of the matter, and there we came to an impasse. So in order to break this impasse, a deal was reached and it was a deal that many of us would regard as being, ethically and in terms of business morals, corrupt. That involved, as it says on one of these many pieces of paper I have in front of me—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon </strong><strong>Members</strong>: Take your time.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>RICHARD PROSSER</strong>: —thank you very much—the payment of something like $11 million worth of cash, livestock, and agricultural equipment to a Saudi livestock importer, and that, we are told, supposedly broke the impasse. But I have to call that into question too, because are we, in fact, any closer to resolving this deal, which was brought to a halt by the end of our live sheep exports, or, at the end of the day, are we still going to have to turn around and, effectively, bend over and lift our prohibition—because it is not a prohibition in law. It is not a ban in law. </p><p class="a">When the Animal Welfare Act was re-examined a couple of years ago by this House, we did not enshrine the ban on live animal exports other than for the likes of bloodstock. We relied on the convention that had been established since the prohibition was put in place. It is still legally possible for us to export livestock to that part of the world. Do we rely on that, or are we going to see the resumption of shipments of live animals from this country to parts of the world that do not have the same ethical standards that we do in terms of their treatment of animals, in terms of the operation of their abattoirs, in terms of the way animals are slaughtered, and in terms of the way animals are treated? Have we essentially sold our soul for the paltry sum of $11 million to placate one individual—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>David </strong><strong>Seymour</strong>: It's not poultry.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>RICHARD PROSSER</strong>: —$11 million, Mr Seymour—in the scheme of New Zealand's sheep exports, and our meat exports overall, which ground this economy in total? Yes, $11 million is a paltry sum. It is a paltry sum, Mr Seymour, and I think you really should take that on board, because, Mr Seymour, some things are actually more important than bottom lines and some things are more important than paying lip service to concepts such as ethical behaviour. Sometimes corruption is corruption, even if it is something that would not lead to a conviction in a court of law. If it is immoral, if it is unethical, and if it is business practice that we as a nation do not want to be associated with, then it is a very paltry sum for selling our soul, Mr Seymour. </p><p class="a">The report goes on to say that "It is not clear on what basis the amounts paid to the Saudi Arabian investor's company under the contract were arrived at.", so there is a complete lack of transparency throughout this entire matter. There has been from the beginning, and New Zealand First was saying so a long time ago. Back in May 2015 we said that the deal was "a new low in New Zealand diplomacy". "A disgrace" and "borders on bribery", said our leader, the member for Northland, the Rt Hon Winston Peters. He then said: "New Zealand has been successfully blackmailed by two highly connected Saudi businessmen who have said 'pay up or else your free trade deal is sunk'. We are paying for their business decisions. That opens up a Pandora's Box of potential claims bearing in mind agreements like the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) now being negotiated." </p><p class="a">If this is something that the Auditor-General can discover in looking into one single deal like this, what on earth are we going to find when we eventually get to the behind-the-scenes negotiations that went on for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which, depending on the outcome of the US election, may or may not happen. And that may be a very good thing. </p><p class="a">Going back to before the 2008 general election, which is slightly after this matter came to a head, we still have not been told what promises were made by senior National Party figures to George Assaf of Awassi Ltd, and especially to the Saudi Minister of Agriculture, who visited Mr Assaf's Hawke's Bay farm on 16 July of that year. </p><p class="a">There is so much that is left unanswered by this report and by the questions that have arisen as a result of this report that we are almost at a point where, although we have to accept the findings of the Auditor-General because we do not call the integrity of the Auditor-General into question—I think that office has demonstrated over the years that it is above impeachment in that regard—it is quite likely that we are probably going to have to have a full commission of inquiry into this entire matter because it is rotten to the core. That is obvious to everyone. It is obvious to the average person, it should be obvious to every member in this House, and it is going to be obvious to the public. They are going to be asking those questions, and they deserve to have those questions answered. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 15:58:24" ></a><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON (Attorney-General)</strong>: That was a fascinating contribution from Mr Prosser. It was more pitiful than his usual contributions, because in the space of less than 10 minutes we heard that this involved selling our souls, corruption, a new low, bribery, blackmail, and rotten to the core. It seems that rather than reading the report of the Auditor-General, he has opened <em>Roget's Thesaurus</em> to find the most colourful words that he could before he gave us that rather sad and pitiful effort. </p><p class="a">Frankly, Mr Shaw was just as bad, because in the space of a few minutes—we did not get the full speech time from him—we heard it was intolerable, a litany of incompetence, rogue behaviour, dodgy behaviour, not transparent. Well, let me say to honourable members that if there is an urgent debate in this House, then I suggest it is important to read the document and have an understanding of the transaction and have an understanding of the findings—not dive for a dictionary or a <em>Roget's Thesaurus</em>, come up with the most colourful phrases you can—and cut to the chase and have a cold, hard, analytical analysis of what exactly went on. </p><p class="a">Throughout this process we have had exactly the kind of florid rubbish that typified Mr Prosser's speech, and also Mr Shaw's speech, rather than focusing on the facts. I know that focusing on the facts is something New Zealand First is particularly bad at, given its extraordinary performance in question time yesterday, but that is precisely what I want to do. I want to say something first about the process, because there have been a number of complaints from Mr Parker and others that this report has taken too long to get out, that people have not been cooperating, and that lawyers have got involved. </p><p class="a">The process that was followed by the Auditor-General in this matter was perfectly standard. It has been adopted whenever there is an inquiry that those who could be the subject of criticism have the draft report given to them and they have an opportunity to make a comment for natural justice reasons. All that sort of work has taken a considerable amount of time, and now the report has come out. The critical thing about the report—and please, Mr Prosser; I suggest to him that he listen—there is no evidence of bribery, corruption, or facilitation payments. The report finds that all public money was spent within necessary financial approvals. That is the issue that the Auditor-General was asked to reflect on and report on.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Clayton </strong><strong>Mitchell</strong>: That you can even stand there and try to defend it shows how out of touch your moral compass is, Mr Finlayson. It's a disgrace.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER </strong><strong>FINLAYSON</strong>: For the benefit of the big mouth from west Auckland, that is exactly what the Auditor-General—I am sorry, it was not him; it was the fellow from Tauranga. That is the point that has been established beyond doubt by the Auditor-General: there is no evidence of bribery, corruption, or facilitation payments. </p><p class="a">What is also clear is that the National Government, in 2008, inherited a problem that carried with it major diplomatic, economic, and legal risk, and in his contribution this afternoon Mr McCully has spent some time addressing the diplomatic and the economic risk. What I would like to do is briefly touch on the legal risk, because the legal risk is pretty clear for anyone to see. What if, for example, a proceeding was commenced in the Saudi Arabian courts against the New Zealand Government? Would we have the benefit of sovereign immunity? What would the cause of action be? Would it be determined by Saudi Arabian law or New Zealand law? These are all the sorts of questions that a reasonable person, when analysing legal risk, would take into account in determining whether or not a matter should be settled. </p><p class="a">I can recall, many years ago, as a litigator, being involved in a case where a New Zealand company was sued in Texas, in Harris County District Court. No one paid too much attention to it until they realised that the law that would govern the particular cause of action, which was breach of confidence, would be Texas law, and that it would be heard before a jury presided over by a judge who had been elected in the Republican landslide and was a probate lawyer. So all those factors were brought to mind when determining what exactly the legal risk was, and, even though the cause of action was flaky, a decision was made that because of the legal risk of litigating in Texas in a difficult situation, there needed to be a settlement. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Clayton </strong><strong>Mitchell</strong>: What about the price of avocados in China?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER </strong><strong>FINLAYSON</strong>: That kind of thing happens all the time when one is dealing with litigation in foreign parts. The member interrupts: "Well, would that apply in China?". Well, of course it would. You would need to assess what would happen if you were litigating in China. These sorts of things happen all the time. There needs to be a mature assessment of legal risk, and that is exactly what has happened. When one looks at the legal risk—which I, as a litigator, thought was blindingly obvious—and one also looks at the issues of diplomatic and economic risk, then one is led to the need to sort this matter out as quickly as possible. </p><p class="a">Linked with legal risk, for example, is that if the case was held up in the Saudi Arabian courts for a number of years, that would of itself have infected our relationship with Saudi Arabia and caused immense economic harm of its own. I know that Mr Prosser does not like the facts. He prefers to stand up and give a B-grade theatrical address relying on words like "corruption" and "bribery", but, at the end of the day, they are serious allegations. He is protected by absolute privilege in this place, but one has got to come up, for one's own credibility, with a few facts, and facts and Mr Prosser do not necessarily go hand in hand. Vague, immature waffle and Mr Prosser go hand in hand. </p><p class="a">So that is the analysis of the legal risk. That is why there needed to be a solution to this matter, one that incorporated addressing the threefold problems of a diplomatic risk, a legal risk, and an economic risk, as a result of which Mr McCully—I believe, quite properly—said this matter needed to be sorted out, and reached a conclusion. Mr McCully has stood up in this House this afternoon and acknowledged that maybe the process was not A-grade, and he took that on the chin as one would expect him to do. There are matters that are raised in the Auditor-General's report that all Ministers need to reflect on: to dot the i's and cross the t's—fair enough. </p><p class="a">But I come back to the core issue here. After all the months, in this House and outside of this place, and in press releases, of allegations of bribery and a litany of corruption—all those sorts of things—what do we find from the Auditor-General? There was no evidence of bribery, corruption, or facilitation payments. At the end of the day, after all the purple prose, after all the hyperbole, the facts do not support what the Opposition has been saying for a year. </p><p class="a">Quite frankly, at the end of the day, this Government, in 2008, inherited a mess. It needed to address the various risks; it addressed the various risks. Maybe, in terms of process, things could have been done better, but there was no finding of bribery or corruption. So my suggestion to Mr Prosser is that it is very important to look at the facts when determining this matter. It would help, when we are debating a report in future, if he has actually skimmed over it, read the summary, or had the summary read to him, because these are important issues, and one is dealing with the integrity—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon </strong><strong>Member</strong>: He's insulting someone. He's on fire again.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER </strong><strong>FINLAYSON</strong>: I am sorry to pick on Mr Prosser, but it was a pretty lousy contribution. At the end of the day, what Mr McCully did in terms of process could have been better, but in terms of substance he needed to address a very tricky issue and he did so. Quite frankly, I think members who blandly and eagerly toss around phrases like "bribery and corruption" owe Mr McCully an apology.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 16:07:58" ></a><strong>DAVID SHEARER (Labour—Mt Albert)</strong>: As Attorney-General, you have to stand up every now and then and give these sorts of speeches in Parliament where you know deep down in your heart that there is something deeply wrong. That sounded a lot like a lawyer defending somebody he knew was guilty and was going down, and he had to give him the best send-off that he could. That is what it was—it was a send-off. </p><p class="a">The risk here is about New Zealand's reputation. That is what it is. We have a reputation for transparency, for honesty, for non-corruption, and Mr McCully has sullied that reputation. It is one of the reasons why our ranking by Transparency International has gone from No. 1 to No. 4. It is because Mr McCully has used this backroom, creative accounting—creative solution, as the Prime Minister calls it—but it is more about corruption in the minds of New Zealanders when they hear this. This is a backroom deal. It is one of Mr McCully's loose, hip-pocket, avoid scrutiny at all costs type of remedies for a problem that actually does not exist. </p><p class="a">Let us start with one major—one major—fallacy that has been brought up not only by Mr McCully but by the Attorney-General today that somehow the Government inherited this problem. It did not inherit this problem. We banned live sheep exports in 2004 when 5,000 sheep died. There was no public appetite, no public appetite whatsoever, for live sheep exports from New Zealand to around the world. That is the reality. The New Zealand Government, that Government, in 2009 reaffirmed that there were going to be no live sheep exports and it did it a second time—two times it reaffirmed that, and Mr Key said himself that there was no appetite in the New Zealand public for the resumption of live sheep export. That—that—is fact, so do not put it on this side of the House. They agreed with it, and they know that the public is not behind them on it. So let us just get that right out of the way from the very beginning. </p><p class="a">The Attorney-General talked about this purple prose. He did mention the word transparency. Well, let us read what the Auditor-General said about transparency: "This lack of transparency, both at the time of the decision and subsequently, has led to the concerns from the New Zealand public about the nature of the payments made. To date, explanations from Ministers or officials have not resolved those public concerns." The people do not believe the Government. Let us go back and remind ourselves what actually happened here. What actually happened? Six million dollars was paid to the Al-Khalaf Group to set up an agricultural hub in the middle of the Saudi desert—the middle of the Saudi desert. It was a disgrace. Rather than highlighting New Zealand's agriculture, it was a new low—a new low—and $4 million was paid directly to the Al-Khalaf Group. Then we put 900 pregnant ewes on a Singapore Airlines flight and flew them to the hub where 75 percent of those lambs that were born died. My God, if New Zealand wanted to advertise itself as an agricultural powerhouse, you could not do any worse to its reputation than that. </p><p class="a">That was Mr McCully's big, grand plan. Why? Let us ask the reason why we did that. Well, the Attorney-General just explained that it was because we were going to be threatened with a suit of $30 million—and to just accept that. Except that we had absolutely—absolutely—no evidence that that was going to happen. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) has yet to come up—has yet to come up—with any sort of evidence that shows that that was about to happen. The Al-Khalaf Group—let us ask them. They said no, they were never intending to sue. They were never going to sue. Treasury was not informed about what this payment was and what it was for and why it was being handled. There were absolutely no grounds that we were going to be sued, and even then it was $13 million. Yet we, New Zealand, our taxpayers, our hard-earned tax money was handed over to Mr Khalaf in that ridiculous way—in that ridiculous way. So that is the first reason. That is the first reason why we paid over $11.5 million of taxpayers' money to a shonky backroom deal that Mr McCully came up with. </p><p class="a">The second reason was that we were about to get a free-trade agreement, which, of course, has not happened. We have not yet got a free-trade agreement. There is lots of purple prose about how it is imminent and how it is coming. We do not know anything about whether Mr Al Khalaf was responsible for the progress or whether that progress might have happened in any case. If we are to believe Mr McCully, this is about Mr McCully paying a Saudi businessman a large sum of money in order for that Saudi businessman to then put pressure on the Saudi Government to enable us to have a free-trade agreement. So what does that sound like to you? What does that sound like to people in New Zealand? That is the sort of thing that goes on in other countries, but I did not think it would go on here in New Zealand. I do not care what the Auditor-General says. That to me sounds like her definition of a bribe that she has laid out in the table in this report. That is what it sounds like to me. </p><p class="a">In addition to that, let us go through the Cabinet paper that Mr McCully's office—as opposed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade—put together in its backroom. All of these things were not answered in the Cabinet paper, yet we agreed to hand over the money. It did not identify how the $10 million figure was arrived at. Why not $20 million? Why not $5 million? Why not $3 million? Who knows? It was just a number that Mr McCully dreamt up. It signalled that the risk of a claim against the Government was based on $20 million to $30 million, but we do not know whether it was going to be $20 million to $30 million, $100 million, $2 million, or, as I have just said, whether it was unlikely to ever have happened. It did not include any analysis about whether there were any other potential obstacles about getting a free-trade agreement. Maybe there were other things. It actually happened to go down the tubes at around the same time as the global financial crisis, and we know that was a factor too. It identified that New Zealand exports could double with a free-trade agreement, but without any analysis about how it could double. The Auditor-General said: "Based on these … shortcomings, I am concerned at the lack of robust analysis and the quality of information that was provided to Cabinet on this matter." Mr McCully had this creative solution but had absolutely nothing behind it. It was a shambolic shambles of a document. You have only to read it to think: "I don't know how that got through the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I expected better from their lawyers and their people." This did not even go through them; this came from Murray McCully's office straight into Cabinet—straight into Cabinet—without going through the pre-Cabinet committee meetings. </p><p class="a">This is a disgrace. It puts New Zealand's reputation at a low ebb. It has circulated widely that somehow New Zealand, rather than being a transparent, open country that would never resort to payments to business people in order to get favours, has done exactly that—has done exactly that. I think it is a real shame, and if you want to pick the eyes out of this and say that nobody was corrupt and nobody paid bribes and nobody benefited individually, except for, obviously, the Al-Khalaf Group, and Murray McCully did not pocket any money—I did not expect that it would find that, but what it has shown is that this was a shambles. It was an utter shambles, and the Government should actually be ashamed of itself that it has got this far. It has brought great discredit to New Zealand's reputation.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 16:17:48" ></a><strong>DAVID SEYMOUR (Leader—ACT)</strong>: The events that led to the Auditor-General's report and this debate are the result of Government acting outside what should be its proper role. The proper role of government is to provide a limited basket of public goods and a regulatory environment in which real business people can get on with building their businesses, not politicians attempting to be business people with taxpayers' money. </p><p class="a">If you begin at the beginning of this saga, it commenced with poor regulatory practice and confusion over whether or not New Zealanders are supposed to be able to export live sheep and under what circumstances. Had that simple question been answered in a clear and principled way, we would not be here. But, of course, the Opposition, when in Government, banned live sheep exports. The Government promised some people that they would reverse the ban and then did not, and throughout this there was no principled approach to how a Government should regulate. But then it got worse. Then we got an activist Government that attempts to wheel and deal and make commercial deals and pick winners and try to be an activist Government in business with taxpayers' money. You can hear the Opposition members thinking "That's right. That's what this Government does all the time. That's what they did with Skycity, trading regulatory favours to have a convention centre. That's what they do regularly with the Major Events Development Fund.", but I have got news for the Opposition members. They have absolutely no right to criticise any of those practices, because they themselves are guilty of exactly the same principles and exactly the same philosophy.</p><p class="a">Let us just ask the Green Party how their so-called Green Investment Bank would pick winners. If you have a Green Investment Bank, you are picking technologies that will not attract capital in an open market. You are picking them precisely because they fit your particular political preferences. A Green Investment Bank would be just as open to the kind of corruption the Opposition has been accusing the Government of today. But what about the Labour Party? Is anybody aware of anybody who has proposed a $2 billion railway straight down the Dominion Road with no business case? Is anyone aware of anybody who has recently done that? The fact of the matter is that the two marital partners of Labour and the Greens are just as guilty of activist government as any Government on this side of the House has ever been—wheeling and dealing, picking winners, and trying to get into business with other people's money—which inevitably leads to precisely the issues we are debating. But what about the very vocal New Zealand First members? They have got a lot to say for themselves, or at least many words very loudly, but very little thought. Who in New Zealand First does not want to give more money to their own particular preferred hobby horse—or should that be trains? Actually, "horse" was not a bad metaphor.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Denis </strong><strong>O'Rourke</strong>: What about charter schools—is that a hobby horse?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>DAVID SEYMOUR</strong>: How many in New Zealand First know their own history of giving oodles and oodles of cash, taxpayers' hard-earned money, to the racing industry because it fits their particular preferences? How many of them would love to give hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars more money to KiwiRail to open non-viable railway lines? I hear members asking: "What about partnership schools, kura hourua?". If they cannot tell the difference in contracting for a service that it is part of the core role of Government to provide on a contestable basis, getting better results for the students, then I do not know how to help the members from New Zealand First. </p><p class="a">The fact of the matter is that the events today are not extraordinary. They are symptomatic of a Government and of Governments from both sides of the House, of both stripes, that think it is the most normal thing in the world for an activist Government to wheel and deal, to pick winners, and to spend other people's money on its own political prerogatives of the day, and all of the Opposition members who have been crowing about this report have no different principles from that which they are criticising today. Only the ACT Party truly believes in low, flat taxes, a stable regulatory environment, and letting business people get on with building businesses, not politicians pretending to be business people with taxpayers' money.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 16:23:05" ></a><strong>Dr DAVID CLARK (Labour—Dunedin North)</strong>: That Government is so out of touch. That is what this report shows. It is so out of touch that it thinks it can thumb its nose at transparency, at common ethics, and at public concern. This is not a report that exonerates the Government. This is a report that examines the evidence, provides narrow definitions of "corruption" and "facilitation payment", and finds that the bar, which is set very high, is not one that can be proven to have been met. </p><p class="a">There is so much surrounding evidence that is incredibly damning, and there is a finding that Ministers have severely lacked in their duties. They have not carried out their duties as they should. That is abundantly clear in this report. The definitions used, as I have said, were narrow. The report shows that it cannot be proven beyond doubt that a Minister was involved in corrupt activities, but the central claim of the Government that a cash payment resolved a legal dispute is shown to be absolute hogwash—absolute hogwash. No legal advice was sought by the Minister. </p><p class="a">Mr McCully himself wrote the Cabinet paper. Mr McCully wrote the Cabinet paper. The Auditor-General lays that bare. Mr McCully claimed there was a legal dispute that was being resolved by this cash payment, yet he sought no legal advice whatsoever. There is no evidence that a legal dispute was in train or ever would be in train. These are the findings in the Auditor-General's inquiry into the Saudi sheep scandal. The Auditor-General openly says that she shares the concerns of many New Zealanders about this arrangement. </p><p class="a">I quote from the report: "I found significant shortcomings in the paper put to Cabinet in support of the decision to enter into the Saudi Arabia Food Security Partnership. The contract's benefits to New Zealand were unclear in the Cabinet paper, the business case, and its subsequent implementation. It is not clear on what basis the amounts paid to the Saudi Arabian investor's company under the contract were arrived at. A key objective of the Saudi Arabia Food Security Partnership was to remove a perceived obstacle to a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council. That agreement remains unsigned,"—i.e. if that were the impediment, you would have thought that the agreement would have been signed by now. </p><p class="a">The Auditor-General goes on to raise further concerns about transparency, about the effectiveness of the arrangement, and about shoddy practices. I would encourage members in the House and outside the House to read this report in full, as Mr McCully did. Mr McCully did it under the guise that it gets him off the hook. I am doing it because it shows a shoddy Government with weak practices that is not observing the rules of common decency and is failing to be transparent in its dealings with the public. It is out of touch. It is arrogant to think that a proper process should not be followed with the spending of Government money. In so far I agree with the previous speaker, David Seymour. </p><p class="a">The Auditor-General also says in this report that there is a range of questions that remain unanswered. She has an expectation that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise will assess and report on the value of the whole spend once the partnership money has been spent. That is something she is yet anticipating. She says she is unsure about the value of this spend. There is nothing in here that convinces her that this was money well spent, and, indeed, right up front she says that the parameters of her investigation were very narrow. I think there will be more questions to come on this. This does not put an end to the discussion. It is a report that does not exonerate the Government. In fact, it opens more questions about the Government's failed and shoddy deal, the Saudi sheep scandal. </p><p class="a">It also says in here that the Auditor-General found mixed messages and a general lack of transparency, and this is a pattern. It has to be said that this is a pattern that is growing, and the Auditor-General refers to a growing number of accusations of corruption over her time in the office. "Accusations of corruption and bribery should be of concern to us all.", she says. That is her final conclusion in the overview at the start of the report. </p><p class="a">She concentrates, too, on the mixed messages that have been sent, and that is Ministers not being straight. That is Ministers not being principled. They are saying one thing to one party, another to the next, and a third thing to the media, and they are not releasing the documents in a timely fashion, to cover up a scandal. We have seen it with child poverty. Ministers do not admit that happens. We have seen that they do not think there is a housing crisis, when people are sleeping in cars, and we have seen it in Skycity, which the Auditor-General said was a deal that was neither transparent nor even-handed. We have got another one here. There are plenty more questions to come on the Saudi sheep scandal.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 16:28:17" ></a><strong>MARK MITCHELL (National—Rodney)</strong>: I was just wondering whether I might share my own context around how this whole situation has arisen.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Carmel </strong><strong>Sepuloni</strong>: Only if it's relevant.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MARK MITCHELL</strong>: Well, I think it is relevant. If I go back to April 2010, at that time I had been living in the Middle East with my family for a fairly long time. I was still very involved in trying to grow my own business up there, and I was lucky enough to be asked to assist with a trade delegation that was coming up to the Middle East. It was led by our Prime Minister and also had our Minister of Trade, Tim Groser, on it. Of course, everyone will remember that shortly after arriving in the Middle East we had a tragedy back home. On Anzac Day one of our Iroquois went down and we lost three of our servicemen. The Prime Minister, of course, did absolutely the right thing: he decided to come home to do what he could to support the families and be here with the nation over what was a very difficult time.</p><p class="a">Our trade Minister stayed out there and carried on with the delegation. I was lucky enough to get some time with him, along with some other business people—Kiwis who had been up in the Middle East for a long time—and we raised with him and talked with him about the issue around the free-trade agreement. He was very open with us about the fact that there was a real challenge to face, and that was around this issue with live sheep shipments and the perception that an agreement had been broken, and that that lay with Saudi Arabia—which, of course, is extremely influential and has a leadership role within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).</p><p class="a">I just want to address, at this point, the point that Mr Shearer made around the fact that the Government is trying to blame the Labour Party, which was in Government at the time that the agreement was made. I do not know the context and I do not know the details around why that agreement was made. I am certainly not pointing the finger at you. I do not want to see five or six thousand of our Kiwi sheep lost while being moved in an ocean shipment. If that was the right decision to make, I fully support it. I think that was the right thing to do. However, the perception that created for the other partner—the Saudi partner—was that we broke the deal. In my world, when I was in business, the minute that you broke a deal, for whatever reason—even if it was the right thing to do—you immediately took on legal risk. I think the point around whether there was genuine legal risk in relation to this deal gone wrong—absolutely, there was. Whether a party was going to trigger that and take it into court, we do not know—that is crystal ball stuff. The Minister was very right when he had a look at the situation and clearly identified that, as a country, we were carrying legal risk. That cannot be debated.</p><p class="a">In terms of economic opportunity, I can tell you now, as someone who was lucky enough to spend a fair bit of my adult life in the Middle East building a business, that the GCC is very good to do business with. We have lots of services and products we can offer up there. We have a large Kiwi community living throughout the GCC, and there will continue to be real opportunities for us, especially around this agri-hub and agribusiness. Is there economic opportunity up there, and was it at risk? Without a doubt. In terms of diplomatic risk, of course there was diplomatic risk. I remember when New Zealand was blocked in getting apples into Australia. The Government got alongside our apple producers—it was the right thing to do. We needed to try to open that market up, and that is exactly what we did as a Government. Make no mistake, the Saudi Government would have taken exactly the same position with one of its own citizens, if it felt that a deal had been broken. We were carrying significant diplomatic risk.</p><p class="a">When I spoke to Tim Groser in April of 2010, he was quite right in saying that this was complicated but that they were going to be throwing themselves and their resources—we have got very good trade negotiators and we have got a very strong Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and they had been working to try to find a solution—to allow us to unlock the negotiations around a free-trade agreement. And that is exactly what they did.</p><p class="a">I would just like to highlight and support the Minister's comments around reading the report. It is important, now that the report is out, that people get it and read it. They can come to their own conclusions on it, but there are a couple of points that I do want to make that I think come to the heart of it. On page 48—bearing in mind that we have not had a lot of time to read the report—"Was there corruption or bribery?". There are four points that the report goes through here—it is very detailed. It is a very good report, and I support the Minister's comments around it. I am not challenging anything in here; he is not going to challenge anything in here. The whole purpose of the report is—they have spent a lot of time, they have gone into a lot of detail, and I think they have done a very, very good job of it. But, basically, the report says: "Therefore, we do not consider that an offence of bribery could be established. We found no evidence or reason to refer the matter on to an appropriate agency to carry out a criminal investigation into corruption and bribery." They could not be more clear about what they are trying to say in the report.</p><p class="a"> "Was there a facilitation payment?" This is another accusation that has been levelled at the Minister for months and months. "Was there a facilitation payment? We were also asked whether there were any facilitation payments. The Ministry of Justice has explained a 'facilitation' or 'grease' payment as a small payment made to a foreign or public official to speed up a service to which the payer is already entitled." They found that there were no facilitation payments. They are very clear about that. There were no facilitation payments. I do not know how much clearer they could be.</p><p class="a">If I move forward: "How was the money spent?". Of course, this is truncated, but—"How was the money spent? The Ministry made a $4 million payment to HAATT Est on 21 February 2013. The rest of this Part covers the spending of the remaining $7.5 million allocated to the Partnership. We have reviewed NZTE's spending from the time the funds were transferred from the Ministry and found that the spending was made with appropriate financial authorities in place." The report is very clear that, actually, the right financial authorities and the right financial processes were in place. There were no facilitation payments.</p><p class="a">If I move on, I actually come to the point that the Minister opened with. This comes to the heart of the report: "We found no evidence of corruption, bribery, or a facilitation payment. The arrangements entered into were a lawful use of public resources, and public money was spent with appropriate financial authorities in place." You cannot be any clearer in the report. The Minister has stated clearly that some things could have been done better, right? I guess that just about all of us claim at some point in our lives that we could have done something a bit better, but, actually, there is a big gap between doing something better and actually doing something illegally. I am very happy to stand up in the House today and support the Minister of Foreign Affairs and say that he, the Speaker of the House, the Rt Hon David Carter, and the Hon Tim Groser, along with their officials, have actually done a very good job at finding a way to be able to unlock the ability for us to enter into strong negotiations around a free-trade agreement. The Hon Todd McClay is progressing that very well up here. I can tell you now, from my own context up there and from my own networks up there—I have invested heavily not only financially but also in friendships and networks—that they feel this thing is moving very, very positively in the right direction.</p><p class="a">If I can just finish up by saying that there are real opportunities that exist up in the GCC. Someone mentioned food security. Food security is very important and is something that we take for granted down here. I would be the first one to say that when those sheep arrived and threw their lambing up in the Middle East, for whatever reason, something went wrong. I did not like it either. I did not like the losses that were faced. There are all sorts of reasons behind that. Climate is the obvious one, and that there was no ability to transition the sheep properly. I do not know—I am not in on the details—I am just guessing. But I would say that the GCC countries are making big investments into being able to provide protein for their growing populations, and, actually, New Zealand has got a huge opportunity there to be at the forefront of technology and innovation and to be able to assist them with the issues that they face with food security. Thank you very much.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">The debate having concluded, the motion lapsed.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Debatealone"><strong>GENERAL</strong><strong> </strong><strong>DEBATE</strong></p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 16:37:52" ></a><strong>Hon JO GOODHEW (Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector)</strong>: I move, <em>That the House take note of miscellaneous business</em>. It gives me great pleasure to rise in the House. It is a red-letter day, but what I thought I would talk about this afternoon is the state of the House. I thought it would be a good time to reflect on what has been happening, and, I must say, I extend my sympathy to the Labour Party. It is losing one of its brightest business brains, and I bet that it is feeling pretty gutted about that. As David Cunliffe goes off to another career, Labour Party members will be ruing that and will be quite worried about that. </p><p class="a">In the meantime, what we saw with New Zealand First yesterday was a laudable attempt to reintroduce its caucus to the public of New Zealand. It left out a couple of members, but, nevertheless, it was a fairly—not even generic. It was a bit of a mishmash, but they mostly got on their feet and asked a question. No one was quite sure whether there was a plan or whether the plan was just to work through the names. </p><p class="a">Then it comes to the Greens. Well, right now I think they are actually in relationship-building. They are not sure whether they want a relationship with New Zealand First, even though it might be necessary. They are trying to build their relationship with Labour. Nevertheless, they have a new member and a fairly new co-leader, and the relationships there actually do not look to be gelling just yet—but never mind. Maybe it is best described as jugglers looking for a circus. Actually, today what we saw was catastrophising, which I suppose is better than what we have had in the past, which was a crisis searching for a crisis—but never mind. New Zealanders are much more interested in the things that really matter to them and Better Public Services (BPS) is certainly something that is important to New Zealanders. </p><p class="a">The National Government has picked some really tough targets, and we are having some success, but there is not a moment that we can be resting on our laurels, because these tough targets require us to keep at them to achieve them. I just want to talk briefly about BPS target No. 1, and that is helping New Zealanders to gain independence from welfare. The number has gone down 15,000 people since 2011. That is actually a future liability for New Zealand taxpayers of $3.6 billion, but there is a much more important thing about this liability going down, and that is the New Zealanders who are gaining a better life for themselves. </p><p class="a">There are 51,000 New Zealanders who have actually come off a main benefit since 2011. That is a phenomenal change in their lives. It has gone down from 295,320 to 279,769 in the last result. Why does it matter? Well, if you are a child in a benefit-dependent home, this is what it means for you: you have a 48 percent chance of not achieving NCEA level 2 compared with those who are not in a benefit-dependent house.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon </strong><strong>Member</strong>: Stop labelling people.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon JO </strong><strong>GOODHEW</strong>: In fact, you also have a 48 percent higher likelihood or chance of being notified to Child, Youth and Family. These are the facts. This is not a label; this is a fact. So having these children in a non - welfare-dependent household makes a very real difference to them. And 45 percent of them are going to end up on a benefit themselves, therefore limiting their life choices. </p><p class="a">I want to also talk about today being a red-letter day when it comes to the household labour force survey, because there are some real highlights we should be celebrating. There are fewer unemployed women: down to 5.1 percent from 5.4 percent. The unemployment rate for Māori is 10.6 percent, down from 12.1 percent. For Pasifika it is 10.1 percent, down from 12.3 percent. That really matters. That means a change in the lives of those New Zealanders and their families. A new measure showing underutilisation fell from 12.7 percent to 12.2 percent, and if we are talking about those 15- to 24-year-olds who are getting out into the employment world, who are not in education or training, it is up very, very slightly, but you know what? There are lots of initiatives there. The important thing is that we are measuring and working on this. </p><p class="a">So we are reducing long-term welfare dependence and supporting vulnerable kids. We are increasing the proportion of 18-year-olds with NCEA level 2, and those 25- to 34-year-olds with a level 4 qualification or better. We are reducing crime. These are the things that really matter to New Zealanders but clearly are not on the radar of the Opposition.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 16:43:12" ></a><strong>RON MARK (Deputy Leader—NZ First)</strong>: I am going to quote something that was posted on my Facebook before we came to the House at 2 p.m.:</p><p class="ClauseAlone">God and soldier we adore</p><p class="ClauseAlone">In times of trouble and in war.</p><p class="ClauseAlone">Trouble gone and all things righted,</p><p class="ClauseAlone">God forsaken, soldier slighted.</p><p class="a">A couple of weeks back, on behalf of New Zealand First, I put out an invitation to all Ministers, to all members of the House, and to those who support our armed forces and our police—including their families—in the battle against suicide, to attend a book launch to be hosted this evening for the book <em>Your Subconscious Bodyguards: The Good News About PTSD</em>, written by Dion Jensen. We put out a press release on that and we gave the background on Dion Jensen. He is a Kiwi veteran. He served in East Timor, he served as a New Zealand Police officer, and he served as a security contractor in Iraq. He has drawn on his experiences in dealing with his demons to produce, through his book, a tool and a programme to help veterans, police officers, and, indeed, anyone to identify their symptoms and deal with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Noting the low numbers of people who have accepted that invitation, we put out a press release last night again advising Ministers that the book launch was happening this evening and why we felt it would be a good thing for people to attend. We followed up with some phone calls.</p><p class="a">It is interesting and, sadly, ironic that this morning we read the story on Stuff of a report of the decision of the Wellington District Court, which overturned the ACC's decision to decline a 56-year-old army veteran's application for cover and compensation for PTSD. Looking at this case, we see the same old issues that have been raised over the last 30 to 40 years. This man has served his nation. He served in Afghanistan and he served in the police force. In the time of that service, he endured several traumatic incidents, particularly whilst on his tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2009. He witnessed such things as fatal rocket attacks, and watched as a helicopter carrying 16 people exploded and crashed. There is a list in this article of things that this man has endured, but what stands out very, very clearly is that, post his discharge from the army and post his inability to continue his employment in the police force, he ended up—as seems to be par for the course—in a battle with the ACC. The ACC adopted a very stingy and mean-spirited approach to his claim. As his lawyer, John Miller, said: "We wonder sometimes how people who argue the ACC points and deprive returned service personnel who have been diagnosed with PTSD compensation can sleep at night."</p><p class="a">Politicians are not held in high esteem by the Defence Force, and there is very good reason for that. Very often when Defence Force personnel deploy, they are sent off with accolades and promises afoot as to how well they will be treated when they return home. We wax lyrical on those deployments in this House and we do so again on Anzac Day, when we laud, applaud, and honour those who die. But where we fail so consistently is in honouring and supporting those who have returned home complete in body but already fallen internally, through PTSD. We throw them back into the mental health system, which fails them. We throw them back into a very heartless, mechanised system we call the ACC, and we leave them to flounder as their marriages fall apart, as their relationships fall apart, and as they head down a pathway to depression and suicide.</p><p class="a">This evening at 6 p.m. we will host a book launch, and speaking at that book launch will be the author, Dion Jensen, and also another gentleman, Major Gordon Benfell, who has an astonishing military career but who is a man who suffers PTSD. We in New Zealand First would like to see those members of the House who support our veterans—and I mean truly support our veterans—appear there. At the top of the list of who we would like to see walk through that door—because they have declined these invitations—are the Minister of Health, the Minister for ACC, the Minister of Veterans' Affairs, and the Minister of Defence. We also note that the Minister of Health is a former Minister of Defence. It is all the more reason why they should front and just listen. That would be very helpful.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 16:48:17" ></a><strong>SIMON O'CONNOR (National—</strong><strong>Tāmaki</strong><strong>)</strong>: I am very pleased to take a call in this general debate. Actually, it will be on the topic of health, which will be no surprise to anyone seeing that I chair the Health Committee. In fact, it is around the work of the Health Committee that I want to begin and just to acknowledge, first and foremost, the people who are putting and sending through many, many petitions. The Health Committee is incredibly busy—just shy of 20 petitions—and, in fact, another one came today from the Life Matters Suicide Prevention Trust, from Corinda and Denise on the steps of Parliament here, asking us to look more into suicide and mental health in New Zealand. We have petitions too from everything from tube weaning to smoking in cars, from the use of marijuana to breast cancer, psychoactive substances, autoimmune injectors—and the biggie, which often comes up, around euthanasia, or assisted suicide.</p><p class="a">I thought I would just quickly touch on that—a sort of an update both to the House and those listening around the scope of this particular petition we are dealing with. It came out of the work of the Hon Maryan Street, as a petition, and the Health Committee to date has received 22,000 written submissions, all of them pretty much unique—in other words, they are not form-generated; these are individual submissions. This is unprecedented in the history of this Parliament. Eighteen hundred people have asked to be heard by the committee—in and of itself, again, unprecedented for this Parliament, any Parliament. And we have elected as a committee, all nine of us, to hear from those 1,800 people, and we are well under way.</p><p class="a">Speaking more broadly now, moving to the whole Government agenda, there is a lot of positive news in the health space for the Government. Fundamentally, and built on increased funding year after year—I know this is constant good news to the Opposition, and just from the sounds I can hear from them at the moment, I am sure that is absolute joy, not opprobrium; it is joy, I am sure. There are three things I want to quickly note.</p><p class="a">One is around telehealth, or the use, again, of telephones and tech services to access health. About a year ago, seven helplines were, effectively, merged into one—so, the likes of Healthline, Quitline, and the Gambling Helpline. Instead of having them separate, now they are coming through one system, and over the last year about 425,000 Kiwis have been assisted. This is a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week hotline, staffed—triaged, if you will—by everyone from nurses through to care support workers. It is a fantastic system. When I did some very basic maths, basically, we are saying that in the year that it has been in operation there is one contact every minute, and 81 percent of calls are handled within—sorry, I have to read my notes on this—20 seconds, which I think is fantastic and built on a $12 million boost by the Government. </p><p class="a">The other thing is around kidney donation. This is something I have been quite interested in and I am sure the committee has too, with the organ donation discussions we have had. In recent days, we have actually had New Zealand's first, effectively, three-way kidney transplant: three kidneys and three donors. This is not the usual way that it works, but it works incredibly well, and with a spot of luck it will help us increase the number of transplants in New Zealand. I think it is really important, too, that we understand that the Ministry Health, through the Minister's direction, is working through some of the dynamics around transplants at the moment.</p><p class="a">The third element I want to highlight, I think, is around the mobility teams—probably forgotten by many in the House, unfortunately. We have invested a substantial amount of money into developing these mobility action teams. That work is around musculoskeletal issues, basically—think of the likes of arthritis right through to orthopaedic problems. So, it is about teams to support people to get mobile, because atrophy—as Opposition parties know—is really a killer. The second mobility team has been formed, and it is here in Wellington, I believe, which will be good news to my colleagues here—including, even, Grant Robertson, the local MP here in Wellington Central.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Grant </strong><strong>Robertson</strong>: I have a high threshold for being impressed, but that does sound impressive.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>SIMON O'CONNOR</strong>: He does sound impressed, and I am very pleased about this. I just want to finish off by acknowledging, fundamentally, those amazing community groups that are supporting our healthcare system every day. I want to acknowledge the likes of the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, which we had here a few weeks ago, celebrating 50 years of medical research. In that vein, I also attended a forum the other day by the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand—amazing work. I also want to draw the House's attention to two wonderful groups, which are coming into this Parliament, actually, in the following weeks. We have got the Lung Foundation, which is going to tell us about, effectively, this cancer killer—the largest in New Zealand. It will come in next week. We also have macular degeneration, one of the major issues for New Zealanders, the week after. So I encourage—I encourage—members to come along and hear about the—</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 16:53:23" ></a><strong>GRANT ROBERTSON (Labour—Wellington Central)</strong>: When the Prime Minister was elected into the office 8 years ago, he stood up and said to New Zealanders: "I expect high standards from my Ministers. If they don't meet those standards, then I will set about doing something about that." Well, today in the House, we have seen the impact of 8 years of John Key's standards. We have a Minister of the Crown who believes that the fact that he escaped the Crimes Act definition of corruption means that he is doing his job well for New Zealand. That is the standard of John Key's Government today: if you avoid actually committing a crime, you are doing a good job. That is how low it has got under this Government.</p><p class="a">Today's report from the Auditor-General on the Saudi Arabia Food Security Partnership is actually, in many ways—because most of the House will know that the Auditor-General is finishing in her role, towards the end of her report today—is sending a message to the Government. She is talking about transparency. She is saying in the report: "I have had more and more complaints coming about corruption." She is saying that transparency matters. To the members on the other side of the House: today we heard Bill English say we are best in the world for ease of doing business—good-o, we have gone up one spot there.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Todd </strong><strong>Muller</strong>: Most transparent country and Government.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>GRANT ROBERTSON</strong>: We have gone down in Transparency International rankings, Mr Muller. We have gone down under the National Government because of the attitude of John Key and his Ministers to the way they go about their work. </p><p class="a">Here is what the Auditor-General had to say about Skycity, the Government's deal with Skycity on the Convention Centre: "a range of deficiencies …", "[did] not consider that the evaluation process was transparent or even-handed.", "meetings [with Skycity and the Government] … were materially different in quantity and kind [from the Government and other parties]", "[it was] poorly planned and executed.", "[their processes] fell short of good practice …", "[there was a lack of] fairness and credibility of the process." It is a pattern of behaviour, because today we have another report that tells us that the Government once again has failed the basic standards of Government: to be fair, to be transparent, and to be even-handed.</p><p class="a">There is a different definition of corruption—not the legal definition, but one that I think many New Zealanders would attest to—that corruption is a dishonest action that destroys people's trust. It is a dishonest action that destroys people's trust. The dishonest action that is in here lies at the feet of Murray McCully and the Cabinet paper that he put up, because in that Cabinet paper he did not tell the truth to his colleagues, and he did not tell the truth to New Zealanders. What he said in that Cabinet paper was that there was some great legal risk out there, and on page 39—since Mr McCully is very keen for all New Zealanders to read all of the report—of the Auditor-General's report today said: "… we did not find evidence of officials' real analysis of other options. We also did not find evidence of Ministers or officials requesting or receiving internal or external legal advice on the extent of a risk of a claim of compensation from the Al Khalaf Group …".</p><p class="a">There was no legal problem here. Mr McCully was solving a personal grievance that he thought might do something for New Zealand—goodness knows what, because nothing has actually been achieved at the end of the day.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon David </strong><strong>Parker</strong>: To facilitate the free-trade agreement.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>GRANT ROBERTSON</strong>: Exactly, to facilitate a free-trade agreement—a personal grievance to solve a diplomatic problem. And, again, as the Auditor-General says in her report: "I was surprised that it was decided to use a contract with a private individual's business interests to resolve a diplomatic issue between governments." </p><p class="a">There are a lot of words to use about this operation by Murray McCully—secretive, incompetent, cavalier, immoral, irresponsible, dodgy—but it is just plain wrong, and this out-of-touch Government does not understand that $11.5 million is not its money to play with. That money could build 31 State houses. That money could give hundreds of hours of special education support. That money could lift children out of poverty. It is not the Government's plaything. Its arrogance that it gets to do whatever it wants, whether it is a deal with Skycity or a deal with Mr Al Ali Khalaf, is out of control. John Key told New Zealanders there would be high standards under his ministry, but all we have had is a record of incompetence and corruption, in my words. Maybe it does not meet the Crimes Act level of corruption, but I think most New Zealanders will see this dodgy deal for what it is. </p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 16:58:24" ></a><strong>DAVID SEYMOUR (Leader—ACT)</strong>: An issue that I hear about frequently in the Epsom electorate, in Auckland, and up and down New Zealand, is not, oddly enough, the Saudi sheep deal. What I do hear about from people with increasing frequency is that they are anxious about inequality and anxious about the levels of immigration, and they tie the two issues together at one nexus, which is the housing market, particularly in Auckland and particularly in the Epsom electorate. I am just interested in why that is and whether these issues really do go together. Is the problem with inequality, the housing market, and immigration really a problem caused by excessive immigration, as some would have it, or is it a problem with a dysfunctional market in housing alone? </p><p class="a">One way to answer the question yourself is to ask how some other markets have been impacted by record levels of immigration. Well, we might ask ourselves: "What has happened to the market for jobs?". Just today, at a time of record immigration, we have the lowest unemployment in 8 years, and it is kind of interesting. People like to claim—what is known as the lump of labour fallacy—that there are only so many jobs in a particular place, and if more people come somebody will be unemployed. The reality of this is that when people come to a country, when they earn money, and when spend it, they create demand, which leads to jobs, or Say's Law, which is that demand creates its own supply. </p><p class="a">You might ask yourself about the electricity market, another market that is free and flexible in New Zealand. What has happened in the past decade to the price of electricity? Well, it has actually gone down—partly because some generators overbuilt in the middle of the last decade—but we have not seen an increase in the price of electricity because there are too many immigrants. We have not seen an increase in the price of food, cars, electronics, or clothes. In fact, all of those things have stayed relatively static. The Ministry of Social Development tells us, and Statistics New Zealand tells us, that the increase in inequality based on consumption over the last 30 years is practically negligible. </p><p class="a">Why then is there so much anxiety about equality, immigration, and housing? It is simply because the housing market—and the Auckland housing market in particular—is highly dysfunctional. It is extraordinary that New Zealand reached its peak in home building in 1974. People should just think about that for a moment. In 1974 there were more homes built in New Zealand than in any year since, and they did not have nail guns, and they were not built by the State—a couple of thousand of the 39,000 were built by the State. Something has gone seriously wrong, and if you want to ask what that is, well, it is simply this: the price of available land that people are allowed to build upon has gone through the roof because of dysfunctional regulation of planning and dysfunctional funding of infrastructure. Those are the problems that we need to solve. </p><p class="a">It also tells you something else, which is that there are two worlds in New Zealand when it comes to concern about inequality and poverty. There is the world that works. All of those markets I mentioned—electricity, clothing, transport, food, and electronics—are free and open markets exposed to competition from the world, or at least very well regulated within New Zealand, where prices go down and people have plenty. Then there is the market where the Government regulates the supply of land, where the Government regulates the standards of building, and where the Government has almost a monopoly on the way that infrastructure is funded, and the price of housing has gone up. It is the only commodity that has gone up in price in real terms in the last 30 years, and it is the one that is the key contributor to inequality and poverty. </p><p class="a">So what I say to this House—and what I say to people in Epsom, in Auckland, and up and down New Zealand, and overseas, if they will listen—is that we do not have a crisis of immigration; what we have is a crisis in the Government regulation of our housing market. That is what this Government and any other Government need to fix.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 17:03:30" ></a><strong>Hon DAVID PARKER (Labour)</strong>: I have already been contacted by a number of people who are absolutely disgusted that Murray McCully and the National Government claim that this Auditor-General's report exonerates them. I am going to go through a few of the exclusions from this report.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>David </strong><strong>Seymour</strong>: I hope he's got some new material.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon DAVID </strong><strong>PARKER</strong>: These are things I have read since my first contribution. It is actually quite a long report; you should read it, member for Epsom, before you say stupid things. On page 4 of her report, she says: "It is not within my legal mandate to comment on or criticise the Government's trade, diplomatic, or animal welfare policy decisions." There is nothing in this report about whether it was proper to do a shabby deal to pay off a disaffected Saudi businessman. There is nothing in this report about it because it is not within the legal mandate of the Auditor-General to say whether that was a proper thing to do or not. She says it time and again. </p><p class="a">The next time she says it is on page 8 of the report, where she says: "The use of a contract for services to resolve these matters was a decision made by Cabinet. I comment below on the quality of the Cabinet paper process but not on the decision itself." Again, she is highlighting to anyone who reads the report that she is not commenting on the morality of paying off a disaffected Saudi businessman in order to get a free-trade agreement with Saudi Arabia. What she does criticise is the fact that the contracts did not set out what was actually going on.</p><p class="a">Next, she says: "I was surprised that it was decided to use a contract with a private individual's business interests to resolve a diplomatic issue between governments. It is difficult to reconcile the words of the contract with the unstated objectives,". She says: "The contract for services was a convenient mechanism by which the allocated $10 million, later $11.5 million, was put towards achieving those unstated objectives. It does not tell the full story." And the Government claims this exonerates it. The Government claims this exonerates it.</p><p class="a">And then there is this issue: McCully says he is OK because he has not committed a crime. He says he has not paid a facilitation payment. Do you know what sort of facilitation payment it was that the Auditor-General was talking about? She was talking about the sorts of facilitation payments that the Ministry of Justice explained are: "A 'facilitation' or 'grease' payment … a small payment made to a foreign public official to speed up a service to which the payer is already entitled." That was never the allegation. It was never the allegation. He has never been a public official. These were not small payments. It was a $4 million cash payment. It is not a criminal act facilitation payment; it is a $4 million payment to facilitate a free-trade agreement. It is still a payment that is wrong—morally wrong. Paying someone off who was not owed anything—$4 million in order to get out of the way of a free-trade agreement.</p><p class="a">Why did the Government do it this way? Well, you know, at the back of the report the Auditor-General has gone to the trouble of setting out how you have got to seek authority for different sorts of payments from Cabinet. She explains that if it is a compensatory payment of more than $750,000, it has got to be approved by Cabinet and "In either case, the payment must be endorsed by either the Crown Law Office or a court judgment." Neither of those things here—that is one of the reasons why the Government has been so unclear about what this payment was for.</p><p class="a">We now know—and it has dodged this for over a year—that there was no substantive cause of action, that it did not have any legal advice, either internal from the ministry or external to the ministry, in support of the allegation that there was some legal risk to it. What if it is an ex gratia payment? An ex gratia payment, she sets out, of more than $75,000 must be approved by Cabinet. Those members are hiding under the fact that this is a diplomatic payment that is beyond her jurisdiction to scrutinise and that, therefore, somehow what they have done is legitimate. It is legal, but it is immoral. It is a facilitation payment that has bought off a wealthy Saudi businessman who had no legal claim against the New Zealand Government. It is shabby, it is unprincipled, and if we have reached such a low stage in New Zealand that a Minister has to be in the dock before he has to resign, I think that is very sad.

I am going to talk about a very significant day in New Zealand history. I am going to talk about 28 October. People are looking around right now, going: "28th of October? What the heck happened on the 28th of October?". It was actually the anniversary of my maiden speech—but no, that was not the historic day. Well, history is yet to tell, but hey. The 28th of October is also my wedding anniversary, and although that is rather significant—28 years, "Nice ring.", "Thank you darling, I bought it for myself and said that this is what you got me."—that is not the historic day. </p><p class="a">The 28th of October is, in fact, the day on which we remember He Whakaputanga, or the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which made this country its own sovereign State—well, recognised it, at least, in the eyes of the British, because they were the ones who drew it up. We already knew it was a sovereign State. We did not need anybody to tell us; we lived here. </p><p class="a">Anyway, the 28th has now been made a historic day that everyone in this nation is going to have the pleasure of celebrating together as a nation, because it is time that we grew up. It is time that this nation recognised its history—with all its warts, with the good and the bad, and with everything that has come from it since, and how that then impacts upon our future—because 28 October has now been set aside as the day that we will remember in time immemorial the Rā Maumahara for our land wars. That is correct. </p><p class="a">I have to recognise the petition from the Ōtorohanga students, who came here to Parliament, because this certainly was the impetus that convinced the Minister, the Hon Maggie Barry, that, yes, something needed to be done. There on the forecourt of Parliament, she committed to that crowd of people—all of those</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">came in and did this massive haka on the forecourt—that she would commit to finding a day and finding a way forward to ensure that all of New Zealand remembers the Land Wars. Thousands of people—in fact, more, we understand, than died in both the First and Second World Wars from New Zealand—were killed during the Land Wars, or the civil war, that saw the establishment of this nation. It saw the confiscation of lands and it saw the rise of the peaceful protest here in Aotearoa with Te Whiti and Tohu Kākahi that then inspired Ghandi and Martin Luther King. </p><p class="a">On 5 November, instead of celebrating terrorism, and instead of celebrating a terrorist act where somebody tried to blow up Parliament, and for years they burned an effigy of this man and thought that that was fun—what a fun night out that would be—let us celebrate "Parihaka Day", and remember what went on here. These are the scars that are left upon our nation. I travelled to Ngāruawāhia this year to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the koroneihana of King Tuheitia, and on one of those celebration days there was a gifting back of land that was taken after a battle at Rangiriri—the first of its kind. While I was there on the forecourt of Māhinarangi, on the ātea, a kuia looked at me and said: "Marama, it's easy to find where the battle sites of Aotearoa are. The road goes straight through them." There is no hallowed ground, no place to remember, no plaque, no grave, and no memorial. But now we have a day, on 28 October, where we, as a nation, can grow up, open up, and discuss the issues that have plagued us all in the settling of this nation, and that is the Rā Maumahara, </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">That is our speech. It is not sheep, but it is important, and I look forward to celebrating the Rā Maumahara in the future.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 17:14:00" ></a><strong>Hon NICKY WAGNER (Minister of Customs)</strong>: Kia ora. The National Government is absolutely committed to delivering better public services for all New Zealanders. Getting the best possible outcomes for spending taxpayers' money is a challenge for any Government, and it is a real responsibility. Spending taxpayers' dollars as intelligently as possible and investing in the right places in the Government system delivers better and more services, and provides better opportunities for New Zealanders. </p><p class="a">In 2012 the National Government set 10 challenging targets for Better Public Services—to produce better outcomes and to focus on getting the best use of our taxpayers' dollars. It is not something that many Governments are up for, but we are absolutely committed to using that money as effectively as possible, and to making a real social investment. Four years later, I would just like to highlight some of the successes of the Better Public Services targets, starting with early childhood education. </p><p class="a">We all know how important it is to get our young people learning-ready. We have increased from 94.7 percent of young children getting into early childhood education in 2011 to 96.6 percent in 2016. Those children are really getting a step up into schooling, which will open doors for them in their future. </p><p class="a">What about early childhood health? Infant immunisation rates and reducing rheumatic fever have been a huge focus of these Better Public Services targets. Immunisation is one of the best and most cost-effective public service initiatives that we can have. We are increasing the numbers of children being immunised, and we have increased them from 84 percent in 2012 to 92.8 percent in 2016. That makes a significant difference to children's health and well-being, and, with that, it supports families and gives them a better quality of life. In the cases of rheumatic fever—that is a dreadful childhood disease, and they have dropped by 40 percent. That is extremely good for families right throughout New Zealand. </p><p class="a">As an ex-teacher, I am delighted always to see improvements in education. When we look at the number of 18-year-olds with NCEA level 2 or equivalent, that has increased significantly from 74.3 percent in 2011 to 83.3 percent in 2015. This means that these young people can open doors, can go to further education, can go to trade training, and can actually contribute and build a life for their future. On the same theme, looking at trade training, we have increased the proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds with advanced trade qualifications, diplomas or degrees. The number of those who have New Zealand qualifications at level 4 and above has increased from 51 percent to 56 percent in 2016. Many of those young people are working in Christchurch. The rebuild has made young people see the opportunities of getting a trade, knowing that if they go through that programme then they can see a job and they can build a future. The number of young people who are not in education or trades is very low in Christchurch. </p><p class="a">You would have seen recently that New Zealand has been seen as the easiest place in the world to do business, and part of that is to do with Better Public Services No. 9, which is all about an online shop for Government service, advice, and support to help small businesses grow their businesses. The fact is that New Zealanders can complete their transactions with the Government easily in a digital environment, and we have made a huge increase in that area. Originally, in 2012, only 29 percent of our transactions were done online, and these days it is almost 50 percent. </p><p class="a">So you can see that these Better Public Services targets have made a real difference. They have targeted how we have spent our money, and they are making sure that we get the very best value for money and deliver the best services for New Zealanders. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

I stand as the Green Party spokesperson on indigenous rights and human rights, because the opposition to the pipeline in North Dakota is directly linked to the political campaigns here in Aotearoa New Zealand to care for our waters, for our land, and for the sovereignty of our very own first peoples. </p><p class="a">The pipeline in North Dakota will cross the Cannonball River and the Missouri River, threatening indigenous waterways and primary drinking sources. This pipeline will carry around 470,000 barrels of fracked oil per day over about 1,200 miles, from North Dakota to Illinois. </p><p class="a">I have written an open letter to the United States Ambassador to New Zealand, Mr Mark Gilbert, to ask the US Government to listen to the call of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and the millions of people around the world who have joined the campaign to stop this construction altogether. Since April, over 90 First Nations groups have gathered at Standing Rock to peacefully and non-violently resist the construction of this pipeline over their lands and sacred places. In doing so, they are exercising their sovereignty as First Nation peoples. They are also doing so in a long line of oppression that the United States has had over its First Nation peoples. </p><p class="a">I have written to the ambassador, Mr Mark Gilbert, not just to call for the halt of the construction of that pipeline but also to protect those protesters at Standing Rock against the intimidatory police violence. Under US international law, police arrests cannot be used to intimidate people who are holding peaceful assembly, but that is absolutely what has been happening. The police have been shooting protesters with rubber bullets, pepper-spraying people—old women, old people—in the face, and dragging people out of sweat lodges. They have set dogs on to peaceful, non-violent, direct resistance. </p><p class="a">Here in Aotearoa, from our own campaigns such as Te Whānau-a-Apanui resistance to Petrogras, and Te Hiku and northern iwi resistance to Statoil, we understand the global fight to uphold indigenous sovereignty and to have a clean-energy future that protects our environment and our waters and earth for everybody. We understand that these fights are connected, and we ask the New Zealand Government to show some leadership in upholding the very issues that are being fought here, in our own waters. </p><p class="a">As an indigenous woman and as an MP, I understand that when I am standing on the banks of the Ōmaru River in Glen Innes to call for that river to be cleaned, it is directly linked to the resistance of indigenous peoples around the world who are speaking out against and showing up violent campaigns of dirty fossil fuel extraction. They are doing the work for all of us, for cleaner energy and for a climate that we can actually all survive in. So it is my job and my privilege as an MP, as an indigenous woman, and as a mother to ask for all of us to support the Standing Rock opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 17:23:24" ></a><strong>Dr JIAN YANG (National)</strong>: I am going to focus on the education results under the National Government. But before I get to the substance of my speech I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our Minister of Education, the Hon Hekia Parata. Minister Parata has been deeply committed to enhancing the performance of our schools and raising the achievements of our students. She has worked extremely hard and has overcome numerous challenges. She will leave this Parliament with a legacy of a modern education system that is more flexible, more efficient, more innovative, and also more future oriented. </p><p class="a">I have said repeatedly that education is a key responsibility of any Government, simply because our students are the future citizens and future workers. In that sense, they are the future of the country. It is important that our students have the necessary skills and qualifications to do well in society and to contribute to a thriving economy. For that reason, the National-led Government has made education a key area of our Better Public Services. We have invested heavily in education since we came into Government in 2008. As a matter of fact, among all OECD countries New Zealand spends the highest percentage of public money on education. We are spending over $4 billion on tertiary education and a record $11 billion on other sectors of education. We have more than doubled the spending on the youngest Kiwi learners since 2008, to about $1.8 billion. </p><p class="a">We are spending a lot of money on education, but at the same time we have been trying to modernise our education system to make sure that it reflects New Zealand, now and in the future. Our efforts have paid off. A recent OECD report, entitled <em>Education at a Glance 2016</em>, shows that the performance of the New Zealand education sector compares very well with those of other OECD countries. </p><p class="a">Also, the mid-year report on Better Public Services results, released a couple of days ago, indicates that New Zealand is on track in lifting participation and achievement from our earliest learners through to tertiary graduates. I will read these three results of education targets: participation in early childhood education is up, from 94.7 percent in 2011 to 96.6 percent in 2016; achievement in NCEA level 2 is up, from 74.3 percent in 2011 to 83.3 percent in 2015; and the number of 25- to 34-year-olds with New Zealand Qualifications Framework level 4 or above has increased, from 51.9 percent in 2011 to 56.6 percent in 2016. We are pleased with all the results, but we are particularly pleased with the increased proportion of 18-year-olds with NCEA level 2, because NCEA level 2 gives students more opportunities for further education and employment. Also, very often NCEA level 2 is the minimum requirement for jobs. Under National, more children are starting education earlier, staying in education for longer, and achieving better results. Thank you.</p></div></body>

What a disgrace. What message is this Government and this Parliament sending to the New Zealand people? Well, they have not been exonerated. This Government had not been exonerated in the minds of the New Zealand public today.</p><p class="a">In the second to last paragraph of the report today on the Saudi sheep debacle, the outgoing Auditor-General said this: "My final thought relates to transparency. New Zealand has worked hard to have an ethical and transparent public sector. Accusations of corruption and bribery should be of concern to us all. During my time as Auditor-General, I have seen an increase in these accusations. None of my inquiries have upheld those accusations. However, complacency is not an option. We should all continue to demand transparency in how our public resources have been used and what was achieved with our money. Transparency is the best foil for corruption."</p><p class="a">Well, what is the state of transparency in New Zealand? This year New Zealand slipped down Transparency International's record, to fourth place, and, as we know, transparency is all about perception. In a report written by a board member of Transparency International New Zealand, it was said: "It is impossible to actually measure real corruption—by its very nature corruption is somewhat hidden and intangible—and therefore other metrics are necessary as proxies. For example, when Transparency International commissioned a survey of public opinion about corruption in New Zealand in 2013, it found that 65 per cent of New Zealanders said corruption had increased over the previous three years. Other surveys have also provided alarming evidence. The State Services Commission Integrity and Conduct Survey of 2013 found that 15 per cent of public servants 'reported observing illegal conduct in the previous 12 months'. And in 2011 a TVNZ poll asked: 'Is New Zealand the least corrupt country in the world?', with 57 per cent choosing the option 'No, we're deluding ourselves'."</p><p class="a">If that poll were taken today, what would the figure be in the New Zealand community? It would be a much higher rate than 57 percent, which should be of concern to this Government—but no, it thinks that being let off the hook for a Crimes Act test means that that is OK, that that is an OK message to send to the New Zealand public. It is not an OK message to send to the New Zealand public. Paying lip service to transparency, not listening and not paying attention to the requirements of accords that we sign up to, such as the Open Government Partnership, shutting down whistle-blowers, intimidating people, blaming public servants instead of taking responsibility as Ministers—all of those things are the pattern that this Government has shown over and over again. What message does that send to young people who are going through school and looking at politics and wondering whether they should vote? What message does that send to the public generally?</p><p class="a">It sends a message about a Government that is out of touch, a Government that is not connected to its community, and a Government that thinks that getting away with it means that it is OK. Is that the message that we want to send out there to our children, to the voters of New Zealand? I do not think so.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Carmel </strong><strong>Sepuloni</strong>: It's a low bar.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CLARE CURRAN</strong>: That is a low bar, and this Government should be ashamed today, and McCully should resign or be set aside.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 17:33:13" ></a><strong>DENIS O'ROURKE (NZ First)</strong>: I want to talk about a report that was issued today by the Human Rights Commission. It is a report called <em>Staying in the red z</em><em>ones</em>. This is a summary of it. If I were to retitle this report, I would call it <em>Unfinished Business</em>, because, really, that is what it is about. Many people in New Zealand think that the issues about Christchurch—the earthquakes, and the red zones, and the people who have been affected by it—are all over, but of course that is far from the truth. This particular report relates specifically to 350 people who are still living in the red zone in Christchurch—350 people—so, for them, things are not over by a long shot. The report that I have in front of me is something that I think the Government should take particular notice of, because it does show that there is unfinished business. There are things that the Government still needs to do. </p><p class="a">Some of the issues, for example, which are listed here, that people have to face because of red zoning—which is after all a Government measure, remember, not something that the people did themselves; this is a Government measure—are that people still have difficulties with their mortgages, people cannot get the finance that they need, people cannot get the insurance cover, and people are worried about services that may or may not continue to be delivered. As the summary of the report says: "Red zone residents have faced difficulties securing insurance for their red zoned properties. At the time of the research almost half the red zoned [residents] had full insurance … while the remainder had partial insurance. Insurance is one of the most significant issues facing red zone residents and it has affected their levels of stress and wellbeing." It is a very serious matter when we know that so many people cannot get full insurance for their properties. That is something that needs to be addressed. </p><p class="a">You might say to yourself, why then did they not accept the Government offer? Why have they chosen to stay and live in the red zone? The report from the commission surveys shows the main reasons. First of all, there is attachment to home, financial reasons, and a perceived drop in the quality of life if they intend to move. Of course, with home prices the way they are now, you can understand why that may be. People also felt that during the process they have been through, they have not been properly informed, that communications by Government agencies have been poor, and that is something, in particular, that needs to be addressed. </p><p class="a">In addition to that, there were the people who were living in uninsured properties or whose land without properties on them could not be insured, and they have suffered. They had to go through the whole process of a Supreme Court decision and the legal proceedings leading up to all of that before they got the Government to really take notice. They are worried about the delay. They have been worried about the difference between the compensation offered to others, the compensation offered to them, and the fact that the compensation offered is well out of date given that so many years have now moved on. </p><p class="a">This is what the summary of the report says about that: "Following the earthquakes, the land revaluation process in Canterbury scheduled for 2010 was delayed until 2014. The new valuations significantly affected owners of red zoned land, with the rateable value of red zoned properties falling dramatically for many by up to 80 to 90 percent. The loss of equity in what for most people was their biggest asset has been a source of stress, and was perceived by some residents as an added pressure to accept the Government offer to purchase properties at 100 percent of the 2007/08 valuation. Owners of uninsured properties, who are not eligible for the Government offer, were particularly affected by the drop in the value of their properties." Those people have not been fairly treated. </p><p class="a">There are many other things listed in the summary, and summarised on the last page are what the key issues are: human rights should be front and centre of this and they are not; the right to property in New Zealand has been compromised by this process; post-disaster actions by the Crown have been inadequate; communication needs have been inadequate; community engagement has been inadequate; and, finally, there is no one size fits all for matters like this, and the Government simply needs to review it again.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">The debate having concluded, the motion lapsed.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="BillDebate"><strong>CHARITIES</strong><strong> AMENDMENT BILL</strong></p><p class="SubDebate"><strong>Second Reading</strong></p><p class="IndentMargin">Debate resumed from 1 November.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 17:38:30" ></a><strong>IAN </strong><strong>McKELVIE</strong><strong> (National—</strong><strong>Rangitīkei</strong><strong>)</strong>: It gives me pleasure to take a short call on the second reading of the Charities Amendment Bill, a bill that is equally as short as the contribution that I am going to make. I do remember 2005 when the Charities Bill was first brought to Parliament. I remember, I guess, a disquiet that occurred in our communities around what might or might not happen to our thousands of charities that operate in all sorts of sectors in our communities. I remember at the time the Department of Internal Affairs, I guess it would have been, put a lot of people out into the communities giving advice to those charities, charitable organisations, and the people concerned with them on how they might or might not comply with the legislation and what that legislation might mean for them. I think you would have to say that there has been very little negative impact from that legislation, so this amendment bill has been brought to Parliament to make some very simple changes, but quite important ones.</p><p class="a">In an odd way, one of the clauses in this bill stops someone convicted of tax evasion, or someone who is, perhaps, not suitable to be operating a charity from being an officer in those charitable organisations—and that is, obviously, clearly very sensible. It also provides that an application for registration as a charitable entity can be treated as withdrawn if the applicant does not to respond to questions. That was an issue that certainly caused some challenges in the early days of the re-registration of thousands of charities throughout New Zealand, because many of the officers of those organisations struggled, frankly, with having to comply with stuff they had never had to comply with before. You can see why that has been brought to bear in this. Finally, it corrects a 2012 drafting error, something that does not happen very often in this House. So with that short contribution, I will sit down.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 17:40:56" ></a><strong>ADRIAN RURAWHE (Labour—Te Tai </strong><strong>Hauāuru</strong><strong>)</strong>: Tēnā koe e Te Māngai o Te Whare, otirā, tēnā tātou katoa. I want to talk about four things. I want to talk about the community and voluntary sector charitable organisations. I want to talk about a couple of the submissions that were made to the Government Administration Committee. I was not on that select committee for this bill, but I have read through those submissions. I want to reference one of those submissions to another bill before this House, and I want to talk about clause 13, which has been struck out, altering section 61 of the principal Act. </p><p class="a">Across our country, charitable organisations play a very important role in society. The community and voluntary sector is one that the Government should be supporting. We have noted and noticed from feedback from the community, from the voluntary sector, and from charitable organisations that they are feeling quite unsupported, really. I think, through this bill, there is a potential for them to feel even more unsupported, and I will get to that later. </p><p class="a">I want to talk about submissions, and one in particular that has been made by Te Korowai o Ngāruahine Trust. This trust is a post-settlement governance entity for the settlement of the Ngāruahine iwi. Their bill is before the House right now, awaiting its third reading. I want to talk about this not only because it is in my electorate but also because I think the House needs to be reminded that participation by iwi post-settlement governance entities is a really important part of our democratic system. These are the organisations that have been mandated by their iwi to represent their people's interests in Aotearoa. So they have a mandate, and I took particular note of their submission on this bill. </p><p class="a">I want to talk further about their settlement, though, because within every single settlement—and I want to remind the House of this—the Crown acknowledges breaches of the Treaty, and then it goes on to apologise for those breaches. My point, related to this bill, is that when the Crown reaches an agreement with settlement groups—with iwi—it is really important that we do not go and pass legislation that impacts on them. What is the point of making an acknowledgment—what is the point of making an apology and then putting up some legislation that potentially hurts them? So that is why I am talking about this particular group and its ability now to engage at this level, even though its settlement has not yet gone through. I want to acknowledge all of the submitters, including this one. </p><p class="a">I come to clause 13, which has been amended and, basically, taken out. It was to amend section 61 of the principal Act with a very small alteration, but the select committee, as I understand it, heard new information about the impact of making that change, so it was removed. Remembering that this bill originated from the Statutes Amendment Bill that is before Parliament, and that if only one member objects to any part of that Statutes Amendment Bill, then that cannot pass, so this part of that bill was separated out into its own bill. I want to make the point, in reference back to what I have already said, that it would not be appropriate, now that this change has been made by the select committee, for clause 13 to actually come back through a Supplementary Order Paper. That is my main point around all of this—I want to say to the House that that would be inappropriate, in my opinion. </p><p class="a">This is a very short piece of legislation. There is not a lot in it, so those four points that I wanted to make—I wanted to acknowledge the charitable organisations and the work that they do in Aotearoa; I want to acknowledge those submissions, in particular the one from Te Korowai o Ngāruahine Trust; I want to reference it back to their legislation, to the acknowledgments of the breaches of the Treaty to them, and to the apology that they will receive through that legislation; and I object to any future inclusion of clause 13 of this bill.

As we have heard during the course of this debate, these are non-controversial amendments that will lead to greater transparency and confidence in respect of charity matters and management of the same.</p><p class="a">In particular, I was pleased to see that clause 11 got the support that one would hope it would get through the submission process and the select committee deliberations, making it clear that if someone has been disqualified under section 143B of the Tax Administration Act, they cannot be an officer of a registered charity. I think everyone in this House and the wider public would see that as sensible.</p><p class="a">Equally, clause 12, introducing the 20-working-days time frame for an entity to respond to notices to provide more information, seems very sound. I noted, in reflecting on select committee deliberations, that there was some concern around that being too tight, but I think the opportunity for a request for extension of time is a sensible way around that. So, as other speakers have said, this is a short bill. It is sensible, it is sound, it has been thoroughly tested, and I add my voice to those of the House in supporting it to the next stage.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Bill read a second time.</p></div></body>

Thank you for this opportunity. From the outset, Labour supports this bill. Drug and alcohol misuse is a major driver of crime. As a preface to a broader contribution from me on this particular part, with regard to the drug issue that is currently happening in Tai Tokerau, I want to lament the recent loss of my nephew Moses Mahanga, who was involved in that particular incident, and, of course, my cousin Mr John Harris, who was buried recently.</p><p class="a">We know that the driver of this particular issue is drugs, so this party supports any bill that will see drug and alcohol misuse addressed as a major driver of crime. We want to make sure that when people are put under supervision, the means and the legislation are in line to ensure that we keep them safe from themselves but, more importantly, we keep our communities safe. </p><p class="a">Clause 4 in Part 1 refers to some very simple matters, and I think they are quite straightforward. The inclusion of the use of the term "psychoactive substance" falls in line with the Psychoactive Substances Act, which was passed in this House in—if memory serves me right—approximately 2013. I did actually have to go and have a look at exactly what some of the psychoactive substances were. I was not too sure myself, but I went in and had a look, and it is clear that there is an issue there. But I wonder, just out of curiosity—and I am sorry I did not sit in on the select committee. For a lot of those drugs that are included in the Psychoactive Substances Act, it is often said that they are undetectable. They are hard to detect in the system, they are hard for the immediate senses to detect, and I just wonder what kind of an issue that may bring for those officers, or those with the powers to enforce testing, with this particular bill. That is just out of curiosity more than anything else. </p><p class="a">It clearly says there in the definition of the term "drug or alcohol condition"—and it is a pretty straightforward change in that particular clause—that "either or both" is being removed and it now says "doing 1 or more of the following:", and that, once again, is referring to the use of a psychoactive substance. In the definition of "drug or alcohol monitoring device", it is quite clear there that it is "a device, connected to a person's body, that is able to detect the presence in the person's body of 1 or more of the following:", and that gets to my point about some of those questions. A quick Google search will tell you how, to the untrained eye, to the naked eye—to make an assessment straight off the bat, it is often difficult for law enforcement officers and for those with that responsibility to instantly see that that person is under the influence of a psychoactive substance. I wonder what the technology looks like—what the device might look like—that will actually allow for that proper testing to take place and to make sure that we are not impinging on people's rights.</p><p class="a">Clause 4 carries on talking about the "medical laboratory technologist", and it is quite straightforward. Those people with those particular skills—and I have mentioned how it is when you first interact with the person under supervision. Clearly, it sets out the terms in here about those professionals who are more qualified and who, with the right tools and with the right practice, can actually assess more properly whether or not the individual is under the influence. </p><p class="a">Moving on to some of the other changes in Part 1 of this particular bill, clause 8 inserts new sections on the testing and monitoring of people with drug or alcohol conditions. We know that when people are put back into the community under supervision, it is important that we make sure that, first of all, their rights are not impinged on but, more importantly, those particular people abide by the supervision rules that have been placed upon them. </p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 17:56:12" ></a><strong>MAHESH BINDRA (NZ First)</strong>: We have supported this bill through the first reading and through the second reading. The reason for that was that we do actually support the intent of this bill, which is to bring the offenders and bailees in line with the offenders inside the wire, inside the prison, so those inside the prison do have permanent and blanket restrictions on consumption of alcohol and drugs, as we know. </p><p class="a">Prisons are smoke-free and we claim that our prisons are alcohol-free and drug-free, and Corrections staff have done a great job at ensuring that those policies of smoke-free prisons are effectively implemented. But there have been instances of those rules being violated, but those are not really, really concerning to us. What is concerning is that the offenders were released on bail or on temporary removal or on temporary release and had these restrictions placed on them. However, there was no mechanism in place to ensure that they actually complied with those restrictions and there were no consequences if they did not. This bill will ensure that those on the outside, those in the communities, whether they are on bail, on temporary release, or on parole, are actually answerable for their violation of those restrictions. </p><p class="a">That was the reason that we supported this bill throughout, although we did have some reservations about how this bill is going to be actually administered. We were told that those offenders on parole and on temporary release will be managed by Corrections, and those who are on bail will be drug tested, randomly though, by the police. We did have some confusion about the modalities and the resources. At the moment the police do not have resources to carry out their core functions of crime prevention, so we wonder how they are going to be drug testing these people on bail when they do not have resources to respond to emergencies. That was one of the concerns that we had. However, we still supported the intent of the bill. </p><p class="a">At present when the offenders are on parole, they are managed by way of drug testing—again, random drug testing—by Corrections. We had pointed out that at present the situation has no requirement that the chief executive of Corrections communicates with the Commissioner of Police while formulating these rules. We were told that there was no need for such a requirement because we have faith in both entities and we have faith that they both will communicate. Well, if that was the case, where was the communication when—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The</strong><strong> CHAIRPERSON (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member, but the time has come for me to leave the Chair for the dinner break.</p><p class="CentredEndingItalics"><em>Sitting suspended from 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</em></p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MAHESH BINDRA</strong>: When we broke for dinner, I was speaking about Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) 163 and the intent behind it. The intent was that the amendment that was sought in that SOP was that both Corrections and Police will be absolutely required to communicate with each other and not just expected to. That is the ambiguity that this SOP sought to take care of. However, the Minister has taken the view that there is no necessity for such an amendment as Corrections and Police already communicate with each other. Well, Minister, if that was the case, what happened to the communication when Phillip John Smith escaped and went right up to Brazil causing us huge embarrassment internationally? What happened to their communication when Tony Robertson raped and killed Blessie Gotingco?</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 19:31:37" ></a><strong>KELVIN DAVIS (Labour—Te Tai Tokerau)</strong>: It is a pleasure to talk on the Drug and Alcohol Testing of Community-based Offenders, Bailees, and Other Persons Legislation Bill. The bill is in four parts, and because New Zealand First wants to debate each part separately, there is going to be a lot of repetition. I will cover a few things off. Part 1 makes amendments to the Bail Act 2000, Part 2 makes amendments to the Parole Act 2002, Part 3 makes amendments to the Sentencing Act 2002, and Part 4 amends the Public Safety (Public Protection Orders) Act 2014. </p><p class="a">Everything that I say, basically, on Part 1 is able to be repeated for Parts 2, 3, and 4. I will just take a couple of points out of the bill. In clause 4 when we talk about bodily samples, we are meaning "a sample of the person's blood, breath, hair, or urine;". When we talk about testing offenders to see whether they have got alcohol in their systems, one of the things we have to be aware of if we attach a device to their bodies is that it is possible for devices to pick up alcohol-based products. </p><p class="a">I remember when I was a teacher and we had a policeman come round to the school and show the kids about breath-testing devices. The policeman got some kids to gargle Listerine. The device was able to pick up the alcohol in the Listerine and it gave a positive reading. Also, there were certain types of deodorant and cologne that were alcohol-based as well, and there was potential there to give off false positives. So that is just something that we have to be aware of. I do not know how great the devices are. I suspect that that will not happen, but it is just a possibility given that breath-testing devices could pick up alcohol in cologne and Listerine. </p><p class="a">Before I got into that I should have said that this bill is designed to stop people who have an issue with alcohol and drugs and may have offended because of alcohol and drugs. If they have a condition that says they should not be partaking of alcohol and drugs—well, no one should be partaking of drugs in the first place—this monitors that. People who have allegedly committed a crime and have been bailed may be bailed on the condition that they do not partake of alcohol and drugs. If they have been to court and been sentenced to a community sentence, it may be on the condition that while they are doing that community sentence they should not partake of alcohol or drugs. If they have been in prison and they have been paroled, part of their parole conditions could be that they should not partake of alcohol and drugs. It makes sense, because we have got to keep these people away from some of the factors that actually lead them to offend, and we have got to keep our communities safe. </p><p class="a">So the Labour Party does support this bill. One of the changes made when the bill was at the Law and Order Committee was the addition of psychoactive substances—not just drugs and alcohol being consumed by the person. We are well aware of synthetic marijuana and the problems that causes. I think that this is a very sensible inclusion in the bill. We are aware of the whole debate around psychoactive substances that occurred—I think it might have been last year—and in many cases psychoactive substances cause as much damage and harm in people's lives as the regular partaking of marijuana, other drugs, and substances like that. </p><p class="a">Another part of the bill that I think is a good inclusion is that offenders are able to use any information gathered to support themselves if they, for example, are going for custody of a child and one of the concerns from another parent is that they have alcohol or drug problems. They can actually use the information gathered by the monitoring devices to prove that they have actually abstained from alcohol and drugs and that they should be given a chance with their child in that instance. </p><p class="a">If we debate this bill part by part the debate is going to repeat the same issues over and over again. Personally I think the time of the House could be better spent on other legislation, but it is the choice of people to debate it part by part. So I will just leave it there at this stage. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 19:37:49" ></a><strong>MAHESH BINDRA (NZ First)</strong>: My colleague Kelvin Davis just pointed out that because this debate on the four parts is being taken separately, it is going to be very repetitive. So just to make it a little more interesting, I am going to focus more on alcohol than I am going to focus on drugs. So—</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The</strong><strong> CHAIRPERSON (Hon Chester Borrows)</strong>: Order! I will just make one point: the member must focus on—sit down. Two or three points—the first thing is that the Committee stage is to talk about his Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) 163, which he has tabled before the Committee and will be voted on in the course of this debate. He must also use this period of time to talk about the submissions that were made before the select committee. In his previous speech, he started talking about an escapee from prison; that does not form any part of this debate. So he must speak very narrowly either to what was raised in the select committee by way of submissions or the SOP that he put before the Committee.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MAHESH BINDRA</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chair. I would like to point out that this is the Drug and Alcohol Testing of Community-based Offenders, Bailees, and Other Persons Legislation Bill, and I am going focus on the alcohol part. Is that permissible, Mr Chair?</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The</strong><strong> CHAIRPERSON (Hon Chester Borrows)</strong>: Yes, as long as he is talking about what was raised in the select committee by submitters and what is the substance of his Supplementary Order Paper 163, but not introducing new material. This is the Committee of the whole House, and it reflects the select committee discussions.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MAHESH BINDRA</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chair. So then I would like to stick to my SOP. The intent of that SOP was to make sure that both Corrections and Police talk to each other when formulating regulations about how this drug testing of offenders in the community is going to be managed. However, unfortunately the Minister took the view that they already do communicate with each other, which I do not think is the case. Had they communicated, Blessie Gotingco would probably still be living. There has been a huge lack of communication between these two vital departments, namely, Corrections and the Police. </p><p class="a">So then I come to the alcohol testing of community-based offenders, which I do not think has been given enough focus. I would like to point out an incident on 1 June 2013—</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Hon Judith Collins</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Chairperson. I hesitate to raise a point of order after that scintillating contribution from Mr Bindra, but this bill—and this part—is about conditions of bail, and the drug and alcohol testing when someone is on bail. It has nothing to do with Police and Corrections talking to each other, and people escaping New Zealand; it is actually about drug and alcohol testing of people on bail.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The</strong><strong> CHAIRPERSON (Hon Chester Borrows)</strong>: The point is well made by the Minister. The member must draw the attention of the Committee to the specific clauses that he is wishing to amend by way of his Supplementary Order Paper, and make it relevant to the part that we are debating at the moment, which is Part 1. So if he could do that, the Committee would appreciate it.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MAHESH BINDRA</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chair. I do take the Minister's point and your own point on board. I think I have spoken enough about the SOP, and I will try to finish my speech here. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="MarginHeading"><strong>Parts 1 and 2, schedules 1 to 3, and clauses 1 and 2</strong></p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 19:49:22" ></a><strong>CLARE CURRAN (Labour—Dunedin South)</strong>: I am pleased to speak in the Committee stage of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Amendment Bill, which has been through an extensive select committee process, and, I think, has come back to the House improved. We certainly support the intent of this bill, which is to improve the way that communities recover from emergencies, and for there to be a seamless and timely transition from response to recovery. This is a pretty important piece of legislation within an even more important context and I do not think anyone would disagree that having New Zealand better prepared and better able to deal with the aftermath of major events is an important thing to do.</p><p class="a">We note that the bill is in the first stage of a wider review that is being undertaken into the legislative framework for recovery. One of the issues that we did raise at the Government Administration Committee was where that wider review was up to. Although this is an important piece of legislation in its own right, it is really just one part of the picture, and so we are raising questions of the Minister at the Committee stage as to the timetable of the wider legislative review, the substance of what that review will involve, whether it will involve more legislation coming to the House, and whether it will be coming to the House within the next 12 months. I think they are pretty important questions to be dealt with.</p><p class="a">We raised a number of questions—issues—in the second reading around matters that we had concerns about at select committee. Many of those were actually dealt with at select committee, which is always an important thing to happen. One of those was our unease around the ministerial powers that were being expressed in the original legislation and the imbalance between the exercise of ministerial power and the consultation with local communities in the recovery phase of an emergency. Mostly, those concerns were allayed—to the point where Labour supported the bill as it was coming back to select committee. However, I do want to keep on the record that we do remain concerned and watchful that this imbalance does not diminish the role of local communities in the recovery phase of an emergency. That role is critical on the ground where the local communities and those representing the local communities are empowered to act, and to do so in relationship with the Minister so that there is not an imbalance occurring there.</p><p class="a">I also want to put on record the appreciation of the time taken by officials in the drafting office to ensure that these clauses have been written in a way that is acceptable to all parties. I do mean that most sincerely, because I deal with a few select committees and I think that, in respect of this select committee, the officials really did go out of their way to ensure that there was the best outcome possible. It was a very good select committee, very well chaired by the Hon Ruth Dyson. </p><p class="a">I am signalling tonight that Labour is putting up Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) 237 to address an issue that we also raised in the second reading, which was with regard to a provision that was removed at select committee on the inclusion of strategic recovery plans. It was contained in the original version of the bill in new section 57A, inserted by clause 21, which was removed at select committee. We believed that the inclusion of provision for a strategic recovery plan was a vital element to be included in the actual legislation as an important signal from legislation. We believe that those plans were vital for the element of successful recoveries and we noted that although the bill no longer required civil defence emergency management (CDEM) groups to prepare a separate strategic recovery plan, the function of recovery planning was now integrated into the general statutory functions. That was what the proposal was—for it to be taken out of the legislation and it be included in the general function, statutory functions, of CDEM groups and recovery managers. Our concern was that the lack of a specific requirement in the legislation raised the risk of poor planning where those groups were weak.</p><p class="a">We know that in respect of the civil defence activity around the country—in the different groups—there are different levels of organisation. Our concern was that there should be a requirement in the legislation for strategic recovery planning so that that could flow down. The argument from some of the submitters was that there was not enough detail, and that, therefore, there needed to be more specific detail as to what should be included. I think the remedy proposed by officials was to remove that function altogether. We remained concerned; so that is what the essence of the SOP before the Committee tonight is. We understand that this is supported by the Government and, if that is the case, then we believe that is very cooperative and a good outcome. </p><p class="a">The SOP affects clause 2, clause 7, and clause 19. It inserts a section in clause 19 that requires strategic planning for recovery from the hazards and risks. We believe that, at least, gives a legislative requirement that will address the concerns that we had about that lack of signal coming from the legislation. Our concerns on that have been allayed. We had concerns originally around the ministerial powers—and so that leaves, ultimately, the concerns around what is left out and the bits of the puzzle that have not been dealt with. These are the large-scale events and response readiness. We think that, although this bill addresses important recovery issues, those bits have not yet been addressed, and although there has been a commitment by the Minister to a second stage of the legislative review focusing on large-scale emergencies, there is no evidence of this occurring in the short and medium term. We, therefore, believe that that leaves the country with a problem.</p><p class="a">So in the Committee of the whole House, tonight, we are hoping that there will be some indication from the Government as to what the next stage will be and when that will occur, because although focusing on recovery is important, so is response readiness. We believe that in every community around New Zealand—some more than others—that response of community responsiveness to large-scale events is critical. This bill makes clear that it is focused on the small to medium sized events. Those small to medium sized events do, ultimately, result in quite massive costs to the country and to communities, so leaving out the issue around where we are going with the large-scale events is pretty important. So we are pretty pleased tonight to be putting this SOP on the Table. We hope that it will receive support across the Committee. It provides an important signal in legislation that all civil defence emergency management groups around the country must be developing strategic recovery plans, and the ministry will be providing guidelines for how those will occur.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 19:59:27" ></a><strong>CLAYTON MITCHELL (NZ First)</strong>: I have to say, I had to rush through a bit of dinner because I was not expecting the last bill to go through quite so quickly—there were only a couple of speakers and it was about 30 minutes. So, anyway, I have rushed back and got all my notes and I think I am ready to go. Good news: we will be supporting this bill through this Committee of the whole House stage.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>David </strong><strong>Bennett</strong>: Ha, ha! That's not a New Zealand first?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CLAYTON MITCHELL</strong>: Despite what my colleague over there—my less learned colleague over there—thinks, we do actually like to support good, solid, robust discussion and also good bills. To be fair, when we spoke on the second part of this legislation, we said that we were considering a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP), and I have to give accolades to Nikki Kaye's office for contacting New Zealand First and myself directly with regard to a potential SOP from New Zealand First. I tell you what, it is the first time, actually—oh, no, the second time; Amy Adams has also done it. I am very, very congratulatory—if that is a word; I think I might have made that up. It is a good thing, actually. So I actually replied with a "No. We won't be putting an SOP in, but we will be supporting Clare Curran's SOP.", and we did have some discussion around clause 19 in regard to the timing of things and that information that is going to be coming out.</p><p class="a">I do have to point out that we would like to see this hurried along. I know it is on the Order Paper, quite high up, and we would like to see it moved through. As much as Gerry Brownlee is probably disappointed that we are not going to continue on all night with this, we would like to see it put through under urgency, because the second phase of this legislation, which is talking about large-scale events, large earthquakes like Christchurch, is really what we need to focus on. And as the climate is changing around the planet, we are certainly seeing a lot more small-scale, localised events and floods and slips and slides and all the other things that create all these problems. So anything that we can do to expedite that through to make sure that we are well prepared for those weather conditions and those civil defence emergencies, the better.</p><p class="a">We would certainly like to see the time frames of this—I think it is 180 days after receiving the Royal assent—potentially expedited by the Minister. If the Minister would like to say the reason why the select committee is bringing it out to 180 days after the Royal assent is achieved to actually bring this into force—we have seen this Government putting bills through the House when we have felt that there has been unnecessary speed and haste. We have seen it do that. And on occasions where we can see the necessity for something to be expedited, it seems to go quite slowly. So if the Minister could answer as to why it is going to take 180 days after the Royal assent to come through—if there is a good reason for that as to why we cannot actually push it through.</p><p class="a">Obviously, the second part of the commencement date is around that provision in clause 19 and some further clarification required about the civil defence emergency management groups' responsibilities in building on their plans. I know the Minister has got plenty of experience with civil defence emergencies because he has been heavily involved with that down there in Christchurch. Some may beg the question whether he has or not, but I believe he has probably been working down there day in, day out. That takes me to another part of the bill, which is around transitional notices. My staple fell out of my pages, so I am going to have to sort of dig through them until I can find them, if you can just bear with me for a moment.</p><p class="a">Transitional notices are a good thing. The national transitional notice for the 90 days gives provisions to the Minister to extend that quite simply, and, also, to add to that, to make sure that they can actually shorten them if required, if the clean-up gets resolved quickly. And, of course, the Minister has the right to actually cease the civil defence transitional notice period. With local issues where you have got a 28-day transitional period, again, this ensures that the Minister makes it a priority to contact the local mayors or local civil defence emergency management groups or the council etc., to ensure that they are on top of things before they actually call it short on a local emergency. We see it as quite a good provision.</p><p class="a">All in all, we certainly will be supporting this through. As I say, our big issue is making sure that this is transferred through this Committee rapidly and is implemented as quickly as practicably possible. We have not heard anything in the way of negativity towards this, and New Zealand First will certainly be supporting positive, good legislation that helps our communities rebuild in times of need. Thank you. </p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 20:04:24" ></a><strong>Hon RUTH DYSON (Labour—Port Hills)</strong>: Can I begin my contribution to the Committee stage of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Amendment Bill by acknowledging Minister Gerry Brownlee, who has picked up the responsibility for the passage of this bill, and also by acknowledging the Hon Nikki Kaye, who brought this bill the House and, as the member from New Zealand First who has just resumed his seat, Clayton Mitchell, indicated, has maintained a very close interest in this bill, to the point of contacting the various parties following their second reading contributions and saying: "You mentioned this; I'd like to talk about it. You talked about an SOP." So thank you, Nikki Kaye, for your ongoing interest, and we look forward to you picking up this responsibility again. In the meantime, you can be assured that we worked hard on it at the Government Administration Committee. You can actually tell that the select committee worked hard on it by the number of amendments that came back and were discussed during the second reading. </p><p class="a">I want to primarily focus, though, in my contribution, on Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) 237, which is in the name of my colleague Clare Curran. You may remember that during the second reading I and others expressed some frustration as we had had in the original legislation the provision about the preparation of a strategic recovery plan. There was a debate about whether it was implicit or explicit. It certainly was not clear; submitters raised that for us. It was Labour's view that we should make it clear. It was National's view that because it was unclear we should take it out—we should remove section 57A, in clause 21. Just removing it did not seem like a sensible way of resolving a lack of clarity. As a result of taking out section 57A, we ended up with no provision to require the preparation of a strategic recovery plan. </p><p class="a">What Supplementary Order Paper 237 does is, essentially, put that provision back in. So, in clause 2, the words "section 19(3)" are replaced. In clause 7, the phrase "the development of strategic recovery plans for emergencies:" is inserted into section 9, and in clause 19, new subclause (1AB) inserts the words "the strategic planning for recovery from the hazards and risks referred to in paragraph (b):" into section 49(2) of the principal Act. Basically, what my colleague has done is what half the select committee wanted to do in terms of clarifying that original section 57A. Unfortunately, it was the one disagreement that the committee had between National and the Labour-Green members on it, and the National Government decided that it would remove it.</p><p class="a">I certainly support this SOP. It is great that National has given an indication that it is going to support it as well. There are lots of legislation where you think it is probably great to have a cross-party agreement, but I do not think there is any more important than civil defence, so that right through from community organisations, to volunteers, to community leaders, through our territorial local authorities, through the civil defence structure, and through to central government we are all on the same page when we are thinking about how we can deliver the best response to a civil defence emergency. This SOP being supported will give a clear message that Parliament has thought about it. We have made a lot of alterations during the consideration, and I think that the Committee stage should go smoothly as a result. </p><p class="a">The other point I want to mention is that during the earliest deliberation on this bill there was quite some concern about the use of a permanent legislative authority (PLA). I was not sure whether any members would seek to amend that provision, because it was raised earlier. There do not appear to be any other Supplementary Order Papers on the Table other than Clare Curran's, to which I have already referred. </p><p class="a">I hope that is an indication that everyone is now satisfied that the use of a permanent legislative authority is entirely appropriate in this situation. It was one thing that gave us a little bit of angst, but because there is no SOP on the Table referring to another tool, another mechanism, I hope that everyone is satisfied with that PLA use. We were convinced at the select committee that it was an appropriate use, and it seems that the Committee of the whole House does as well. So thank you for the opportunity to contribute, and I look forward to the progress of this bill. </p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 20:09:09" ></a><strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE (Acting Minister of Civil Defence)</strong>: Can I acknowledge the contributions from Clare Curran, Clayton Mitchell, and Ruth Dyson. I think one of the things that I would reflect on over the last 6 years, when a number of us had have to deal with situations in Christchurch, has been the fact that Parliament itself has been unanimous in providing support to the city, whether it was by way of the initial legislation or the most recent legislation, or, in fact, the number of things on the way between. </p><p class="a">The one thing I think we can be sure of is that even though this bill is before us now—and it has had considerable thought put into it—it will not be the last time that we have to think about the way in which there is a response to any particular civil emergency. So it is, at this point, a best effort, and I do not mean that in any way that is going to downplay the contribution of people; it is just the fact that we work off the experience that has been before us at the present time.</p><p class="a">The question that Ruth Dyson raised about the ongoing planning, etc., and the two positions that have been taken was, I think, more semantic than fact. The reality is that prescribing, as Supplementary Order Paper 237 from Clare Curran does, the task that is required in making sure that there is a risk plan—basically, a plan for a recovery of risk—is something that we will support this evening, quite obviously, because it adds to the importance of the work that so many people commit themselves to throughout New Zealand in the absence of any particular civil emergency. So they do need to have an understanding that the whole Parliament supports the work they do. Many of them will go about their training exercises, their long hours of commitment to what might happen in a field, and some of them will never ever see an actual disaster. Although that might be a good thing, the comforting thing is that we do have people out there who are trained to respond and to keep things ticking over. </p><p class="a">We had two situations in Christchurch. One, we had the more local emergency—split across three counties in the 4 September 2010 event—when I think you would say the response, although excellent from the individuals concerned, was not quite as good as it could have been because of the structures that were in place at the time. And that is not a bad thing to say that; it is just an indication that you can learn a lot from those situations, and, in many ways, what we have got in front of us today does pick up on that. </p><p class="a">Clare Curran mentioned the need to have a big plan for when you have great big disasters. It is going to be interesting to engage in that discussion in the months ahead, largely because everyone will have a slightly different view on what you do. My own view on it, for what it is worth, in response to the issue you have raised, is that if it is a very big disaster, Parliament will want to have, I think, some say, at some point, in what will be the exceptions to any law that might be necessary to recover from that disaster, and that may be different according to different disasters. So although I do not discount the fact that we probably will get a bill that provides a blueprint, I think you can never totally discount the fact that there might be a need for Parliament to come together at those times and to set aside some things that would be usually done in order to make greater progress for a wider number of people. </p><p class="a">You cannot anticipate that, and nor should we, but the structures of response, I think, we can get a lot stronger, and I am sure the goodwill that this Parliament has, given the experiences that so many of us have had in local areas with floods and other big weather events, and then coming to understand, as many of us do now, the fact that in New Zealand you essentially live with your risk, is going to mean that we will be much more interested in getting a bill that we can all subscribe to, and giving that support to those people in the field who are required to deliver on it.</p></div></body>

I would like to acknowledge them all.</p><p class="a">In my contribution I want to deal with the powers in new Part 5B of this legislation. This legislation deals with how it is we transition from the emergency phase to the business-as-usual phase. I—like many New Zealanders, I think—before September 2010 understood civil defence very much in terms of that emergency phase. It was the yellow pages at the back of the telephone book that told us all what to do in a disaster. That was very much my understanding of civil defence.</p><p class="a">But I will never forget, in September 2010, being down at the Addington Raceway with the then member of Parliament for Wigram, Jim Anderton, trying to do some of the things that the Minister in the chair has just mentioned. And trying to sort out some of the things that were needed that we had not anticipated in a disaster lasting this long: such as where were people going to do washing over a protracted period of time such as this; or how were we going to cater for the ethnic diversity of people who needed to be housed, and for the different kinds of sleeping arrangements that needed to be held at the Addington Raceway. Then, in February 2011, I will never forget being down at the Addington Raceway as people flooded in, thinking that this was, once again, going to be their safe haven in an emergency—that this was the place that they could go to. But, of course, that facility was so badly damaged in that quake that it was not able to be used. The logistics of trying to shepherd people to somewhere safe was something that was quite harrowing to watch, and I would like to acknowledge the many volunteers within civil defence who give so tirelessly of their energy and of their expertise and of their skills to do that.</p><p class="a">I think that is the phase that we can understand, but what I have come to understand more over the last 6 years is how it is that we transition. As the Minister said, there are certain powers that do need to be put in place so that we can deal with an emergency: how it is that we clear roads, how it is that we put in place—as we had to in places such as in the Hon Ruth Dyson's electorate—barriers to stop rock falls coming down, and how we do that at the kind of speed at which we need to do it with, to keep people safe.</p><p class="a">But how, then, do we transition back to business as usual? That is the bit where new Part 5B in clause 28 of this legislation—that transitional period—becomes so critical. I would like to acknowledge here the work of the Government Administration Committee, chaired by the Hon Ruth Dyson, the work that all members of that committee have done, and Supplementary Order Paper 237 that Clare Curran has put forward here. This is because what is absolutely vital in this transitional phase is to make sure that we strike the right balance between trying to do things in an expedited fashion to keep things moving along, but making sure that locals have a real say in their recovery—that they are absolutely part of this transitional phase—and that they feel that they are part of it and they, once again, have some control over their lives. As people come out of an emergency phase, the adrenalin starts to wear off. That emergency phase starts to dissipate and things seem to be returning to normal, and people very much want to be part of their destiny.</p><p class="a">The other thing that I think we have learnt is that this is not a linear process. Emergency recovery and transition overlap, and that for different people in different communities at different stages, we need to have the flexibility to do that. One of the things that I would like to talk to was the suggestion, from the Canterbury District Health Board, that was put up under this new Part 5B, which was that greater power would be given to the medical officer of health and there would be the ability to do that. I think we were very lucky in Christchurch not to have had a public health outbreak. We did not suffer from the communicable diseases problem that people anticipated was going to happen because of the kinds of situations people in Canterbury were living in, in the emergency phase and beyond the emergency phase, and I would like to see that as something that this House kept an open mind to. That is a critical thing that we do need to consider when we are considering those things, so I would like to see that. But I think that this is legislation we are happy to support. I do acknowledge the comments that have been made about how this is legislation that is set up to deal with the small and medium sized disasters and that we will be coming back to revisit larger disasters. But Labour is happy to support this piece of legislation.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 20:19:19" ></a><strong>POTO WILLIAMS (Labour—Christchurch East)</strong>: I too want to acknowledge the work of the Government Administration Committee, and Supplementary Order Paper 237put up by my colleague Clare Curran. I acknowledge that that has wide support, and I am happy to support that.</p><p class="a">I am going to confine my discussions to clause 4, and a little bit of clause 5. In particular, I want to look at clause 4(7), which looks at "recovery activity". I just want to quote from the bill, where recovery activity is defined as "the assessment of ongoing monitoring of the needs by the community affected by the emergency;" it is "the co-ordination and integration of planning, decisions, actions, and resources"; it is about measures to support "the regeneration, restoration, and enhancement of communities; … the cultural and physical well-being of individuals and their communities; … government and non-government organisations and entities working together; … [new measures] to reduce risks from hazards; and … to build resilience".</p><p class="a">In this regard, I want to actually quote the activity that took place in the community of Aranui as an example of how a community deals with a situation, and how it actually works to build that resilience into a community for later disasters. What happened in Aranui in the February earthquakes was—it was a community that was largely cut off from the rest of the city. There was poor communication in and out of Aranui, of course the roads were fairly damaged, and for a few weeks the community there had limited access to water, and no access to functioning toilets. As a community—it is one of our lower socio-economic communities—what they did was they decided to doorknock every single house in that community and talk to the people there, find out who was living there, who had mobility issues, who had health concerns, and where there were children; so every house was mapped in that community. What they did was they ensured that those who needed to be prioritised were prioritised. As communication was fairly limited, they ensured that the resources went to those who needed them first.</p><p class="a">There were organisations—and I happened to work for one of them—who, at that time, opened their doors to ensure that there was a hot meal prepared for people at lunch time, that they could have access to showers, and that they could do their washing. They were simple things that actually meant that a community could continue to function, even in a limited capacity, through those times when it was difficult to get even the basic services through.</p><p class="a">What that did for that particular community of Aranui was it actually set within them the opportunity to ensure that their community was not going to be affected in the same way again. Every year, they continue to do that door-to-door mapping of the community: they find out who has the health concerns, who is elderly, and what kind of support they might need. They have actually, through their own fund-raising, put together a container that has generators, supplies, and blankets—it has enough supplies to keep that community going for a few weeks, should it be cut off again. That is at the heart of what this clause 4 talks about—building resilience. That community has done it on its own. It should be something that, as communities across the country, we actually use as a model. These people realised that in order to get through a significant event, you have to take measures yourself, so they have done it themselves. I want to commend them for doing that.</p><p class="a">Like my colleague Dr Megan Woods and the submission from the Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB), I also want to question why, within the definitions of those key roles, we have not included the health response and recovery manager. As my colleague said, this is a significant role within the civil defence roles and responsibilities. It is something that I think the Minister could perhaps answer—why that was not considered. It is a very good submission by the CDHB, and it certainly is a vital role that should have a place within the civil defence and emergency management profile. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 20:24:22" ></a><strong>JAN LOGIE (Green)</strong>: I am pleased to be able to take a short call on behalf of the Green Party in the Committee stage of this bill. I too want to add my voice to others in this debate in support and in particular acknowledge the members of the Government Administration Committee and the members of the House, and particularly the chair of the committee, Ruth Dyson, and possibly Minister Brownlee, who have both had more recent experience of a civil defence emergency. </p><p class="a">I have got to say that, on the committee, the chair's experience was incredibly informative, and that she knew what questions to ask and she knew what areas of tensions have arisen in the past between local activity and the more formalised systems. Going into looking at this bill, that was a particular area of concern for us. The previous speaker, Poto Williams, talked about the recovery activities in Aranui. We heard some amazing stories in Lyttelton as well. More recently, and on a small-scale event, during some of the recent flooding up in Kāpiti, I know how the community there came together to be able to support people who were affected by the flood, who maybe were suffering financially as a result of the impacts of the flood, and people would take turns to go with somebody to Work and Income to manage the formalised systems. It was actually the relationships and community that were essential to people's sense of well-being in that recovery process. </p><p class="a">It is really critical that we get legislation that facilitates and aids that local connectedness and that local response, but just monitors and fills in the gaps, and provides the more formal systems if a community is unable to provide them itself. I do feel that this kind of legislation should probably always continue to be evaluated after events to make sure that we have got it right. You can never, I do not think, stand up and say "Yes, we've got it 100 percent right." before you have had it in practice. But I am feeling that we made really good progress in the committee, and there were a lot of changes made through that process of questioning and testing it through discussion against the experience of some of the members and the submissions. </p><p class="a">I am really pleased that the Labour member Clare Curran is adding Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) 237 to reinsert the strategic recovery plans into the legislation, and that the Government, indeed, is supporting that. The rationale from the Government members on the committee, as well as, I think, some of the advice, was that we did not need it because within the legislation there is a function of planning that is built into the legislation for civil defence and emergency groups and recovery managers, so there was no need to put a plan into the legislation as well, and it might create confusion. When submitters had raised concerns about the lack of clarity and specificity, and the thought was like: "Oh, well, we'll take it out so we don't get confusion." But I think it is much better to put it in and to get the support of the Government with the guidance to provide the specificity. </p><p class="a">We have heard stories from different places around the country of very different levels of knowledge and experience around planning. So to actually put in the legislation—and to put the guidance behind with it—the codes, technical standards, and guidance for timing and longevity, as examples, I think will help the local, on-the-ground organisers work through those steps of recovery that we want them to work through. The Green Party will be very happy to support that SOP. </p><p class="a">I would also, just really briefly, like to touch on the initial concern—which was raised earlier by the Hon Ruth Dyson—that we had around the permanent legislative authority. I spoke for the Greens as we interrogated that and the officials gave us some very clear advice, and I have absolute confidence in the validity of that as a tool for giving councils surety of funding.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 20:29:28" ></a><strong>CLARE CURRAN (Labour—Dunedin South)</strong>: Just taking another call in the Committee stage of this bill, first of all I would like to thank Minister Brownlee for his words and for the signals he has given for the next piece of work that needs to be done. On this side of the Chamber we would express eagerness for those discussions to start being held and for there to be as much community involvement as possible in those. </p><p class="a">I am certainly aware of some pieces of work being done around the country into various scenarios. One of those is a piece of work being done into a major alpine event, down in the southern part of the Southern Alps, and the impact of that. It is something that we have to bear in mind. Another issue, of course, is the impact on New Zealand of a tsunami following a major earthquake event somewhere else. I do want to put on record here in the Chamber tonight that we have got some real concerns about the ability of New Zealand's coastal communities to be able to respond to such an event. I think we had an instance of this at the beginning of September, when there was a definite delay in the time period before there was an alert provided to the community, and the manner in which that alert was provided was called into question. </p><p class="a">In 2016 it is time that we grappled with the fact that we need a national alerting system and that there are means to do that. This Government seems to have been going around in circles on that. Perhaps it could be the subject of another debate. There has been a considerable amount of money spent on looking into various models, but we still do not seem to be any further ahead. I am just alerting to the Committee that that is something we really should not be sitting on our hands about. </p><p class="a">I would also like to make some comments about the absolute importance of this legislation, with direct reference to a medium sized event—it could have been described as a small to medium sized event—in Dunedin last year, with the 2015 floods in south Dunedin. Certainly for the people who were affected it was a major event, and the response from Civil Defence to that was dire. In fact, it was better described as a non-response. That night, Civil Defence personnel were not even aware that there was an issue in south Dunedin and actually had gone home to bed. They were not even looking at south Dunedin. </p><p class="a">To this day we still do not know just how many homes and businesses were affected by sewage-laden water during that night. Elderly people with dementia in rest homes had to be moved into the middle of the rest home, or moved out of the rest home, in a rather chaotic manner. Two elderly people who had water up around their thighs got back into bed because they did not know what else to do. Two families with small children were left feeling quite desperate and had to move out of their homes for months, and battle with insurance companies on their own. </p><p class="a">I guess the point I want to make tonight is that—it is a plea, really—through what this legislation is part of, through a legislative review, we should address the civil defence organisations around the country that really just are not up to scratch and are operating as fiefdoms, with <em>Dad's Army</em> types of organisations behind them. I know that that is changing, but there are still remnants of those. In my part of the country there have been some changes made, but it has taken nearly a year and a half for that to happen. I look forward to ensuring that that is not replicated anywhere else in the country, and that anyone else does not have to go through that kind of situation. </p><p class="a">Just finally, I want to make a few comments about the permanent legislative authority. I will echo the comments from the Green member—that it is a sensible mechanism—and also from Ruth Dyson. We did think when we had the first reading of this bill that we were going to have a bit of an argument about that, in that this all looked a bit unusual. I think we all learnt something in the select committee about a measure and a mechanism that is actually being used for other things and is quite sensible. It is used as a way of funding New Zealand's contributions to international forums, such as the IMF and the OECD—payments of tax credits, and search and rescue costs. Those are just a few of the different kinds of examples. </p><p class="a">We certainly did receive sound advice from a Treasury analyst, who, helpfully, appeared before the select committee and reassured us that the permanent legislative authority was a flexible mechanism for reimbursement of expenses during an emergency and for providing ongoing authority for such expenditure. So we were comfortable. There has not been any debate on that throughout this discussion on this bill. There were not any real concerns about that. I think that, ultimately, we do have a reasonable piece of legislation. It is a pretty good piece of legislation that has been helped by good cooperative relations across the select committee and good advice from officials. </p><p class="a">I thank the Government for its support for the Supplementary Order Paper on the Table tonight. I look forward to the next discussion that happens around the bigger picture and how we deal with major events in New Zealand. Thank you.</p></div></body>

We will not labour the process tonight; there will be a number of calls from colleagues. This is a piece of legislation that we should get through, but I want to pose a number of questions to the Minister—and I am sure he can anticipate some of those questions. This is a bill that, in large part, proposed originally an amalgamation of the single patent application process and single patent examination process systems, in large part, I suppose, as we on the select committee saw it, to benefit the acquisition and processing of patents in a global sense, trans-Tasman. The Government in its infinite wisdom chose to reverse that process for a number of reasons.</p><p class="a">I have to say of the original Government proposal, Opposition members supported it—in line with amalgamations around banking, accountancy, and other industries that have had their processes amalgamated in the past. We felt that this was a good idea from the Government. Our focus was about ensuring that those who are involved in innovation, who are involved in intellectual property, and who seek patents, which are (1) expensive, and (2) difficult to obtain, especially for the smaller end of town—if this could ease that transition and provide a cheaper process, provide lower compliance costs etc., then we felt it was a good idea. We were surprised, I have got to say, when the position was reversed.</p><p class="a">The position that was advanced by officials was that after some analysis—if I can put it that way, such that it was—this proposal was of no greater benefit to the industry. It is interesting to define what they meant by "industry", because our view was that they were talking about the patent attorneys as opposed to the innovators. We had a couple of submissions from the likes of Fisher &amp; Paykel—huge contributors to intellectual property not only in New Zealand but around the world—but we as members, I think, across the divide were interested in the benefits, or lack thereof, for the smaller innovator. So officials told us, basically, that the scales had fallen from their eyes and this was no longer a viable proposal because it had not a lot of net benefit to the industry.</p><p class="a">On probing those officials over many days, we asked, for instance: "I wonder whether the Minister might be able to respond—what costings, cost savings or cost-benefit analyses have been done around these proposals?". I remember writing that down, and my colleagues, I am sure, on both sides of the aisle will recall this—the officials saying "Well, back of the envelope", and "Our best guess is". Those are direct quotes—and then they would rattle off some figures. I recall saying to officials: "Well, I actually have—and I do put on record—some sympathy for the Minister, because if that was the depth of the analysis that was served up to him, is it any wonder that there was some delay and some conjecture about which way we should go on this?". At one point in the select committee—and I am very thankful for it, as it was rather unusual—in a private session, the Minister's senior adviser was good enough to come down and sit in on the meeting so that we had a direct pipeline to the Minister. So that the Minister would understand the angst that not only Opposition members were feeling but also, I would wager, Government members about—to be blunt—the lack of quality advice that we were receiving before the committee.</p><p class="a">This is not a political bill. We agree, and we will support the bill, and we would have supported the original premise that was put to us. But it is a little ironic when a Government simply takes the major provision out and reverses it; there has to be a substantive reason why. So, Minister , what I would ask of you, through you, Mr Chair, is whether you could give us some reassurance that this reversal is for the benefit of the innovators; that it is the case, as officials told us, that the net benefit to innovators of the trans-Tasman amalgamation was so minuscule that it was not worth doing. That begs the question as to why this proposal was ever served up to a Minister and a Cabinet. Could you give us some assurances around that, because I am loath to criticise officials—I do it very rarely. I think we have world-class public servants, but I have to say—and I do not know whether Government members will admit this publicly—that there was a loss of cross-party unanimity in trying to get this bill back to the House so that it would work.</p><p class="a">There is actually no politics in patents, for goodness' sake. We actually want the bill to work. But what we were met with was, at best, substandard advice—where officials had not gone away and done a proper cost-benefit analysis, and where a select committee was confronted with an analysis that was "back of the envelope" or "best guess". Then we diligently undertook—and the chair of the committee, I have to say, was extremely good in letting us—a free-flow interrogation, if you will, of these ideas so that we could tease out the policy propositions. But when you are left with that sort of advice—and the other advice was, basically, "just trust us because we are the experts".</p><p class="a">The thing that we found difficult also, Minister, was that the "industry" had actually not been consulted with—because my colleague Clare Curran and others went and subsequently, with the agreement of the committee, consulted with the innovators. Clare Curran will identify some of those in her contribution. When they actually consulted with them, they had never been interacted with before. Our objective was simply to get a piece of legislation that would facilitate the protection of intellectual property for the innovative community, especially those at the smaller end of town, to protect those fabulous and good ideas that our entrepreneurs have in this country. </p><p class="a">It is extremely expensive and extremely difficult to get patent protection. I have got to put on record that the committee was less interested in the notion of patent attorneys changing—it was sort of put to us that life as we know it would end: the patent attorneys would go out of business, they would leave town, and they were incapable, almost, of adjusting to a market that may change through legislation and regulation, and this somehow was a doomsday scenario. Well, I have got to say that I was less interested in that and more interested in what the benefits or otherwise could be for those entrepreneurs and those innovators—not for those patent attorneys whose incomes are derived by charging fees.</p><p class="a">I would simply put, through you, Mr Chair, to the Minister: could he give us some background and some assurance that this proposal is the valid one, given that it is a Government reversal, and that there is some net benefit for that smaller end of town innovator? Because at the moment even though the Labour Party is supporting legislation, we do so with a degree of reticence given the poor quality advice that we received during the select committee process. As I say, I feel some depth of sympathy for the Minister. If what was served up to us was served up to him, then I suspect he had some difficulty in coming to a decision as to which was the best course of action to take in respect of this bill. We want to expedite this tonight but I would appreciate it, through you, if the Minister could give us some assurance on those points.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 20:47:24" ></a><strong>Dr DAVID CLARK (Labour—Dunedin North)</strong>: I will take a slightly different point of view from that of my colleague Clayton Cosgrove, although it was a very harmonious committee that considered this bill. The one point that I would question a little is his praise for the Minister in the chair, the Hon Paul Goldsmith, and the advice that he was given. I honestly believe that Ministers themselves have a responsibility for the legislation they put forward to this House. </p><p class="a">We are here this evening debating legislation that has been proven to be inadequate and not sufficient for the purpose it was originally created for. Here we are passing through the Committee a bill that does very little indeed. The changes that are going through in this bill could easily have been rolled into an omnibus bill, and hundreds of thousands of dollars, I suspect, of taxpayers' money could have been avoided being spent on paying all of us and all of our staff to be here in the evening debating a bill that virtually does absolutely little of any value. </p><p class="a">We are happy that it does little, in fact; for the one reason that it was likely to do harm. That is where we got to. That is where the back of the envelope - type calculations that my colleague the Hon Clayton Cosgrove got to—that it may well indeed do harm. But ultimately we do not know. We do not know because the analysis was not done in a way that could give us the confidence to know whether this was a good thing we were doing or a bad thing. </p><p class="a">The small changes and tweaks that are going through in the bill we do support, so we do end up, on balance, supporting it. I would be interested in the Minister in the chair giving us a little bit of a history of how he came to put this legislation forward, because the story I heard, and what came out in the select committee, was that this was ultimately the result of a promise that John Key had made when he was out kayaking—I cannot remember whether it was with Kevin Rudd or somebody else—that they would try to unify the arrangements in New Zealand and Australia, which on the surface seems like a sensible thing to do. I would like the Minister to give us the reasoning behind it, and the reasoning he has now reached as to why we should be doing exactly the opposite. If he could slip on his flip-flops and get up and explain to us how he came from one position to the extreme opposite—maybe with a slight Australian twang for some amusement along the way—that would probably be doing a public service. At least we would be entertaining the public, but we might also learn what he hopes the bill will now achieve. </p><p class="a">I think it is important to understand why we are here, why we are passing this legislation, and why this could not have been done through an omnibus bill—whether, in fact, there is another process that has been considered for the bill from here on through the House. That may be something we would have to take technical advice on, but it would save the House some time. We could get on with what would be, hopefully, more important legislation in the wider interests of the country. The one thing I will say is that this bill is emblematic of the Government's wider efforts. It is a Government that has said it wants to get exports up to 40 percent of GDP, and that requires us diversifying our—</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The</strong><strong> CHAIRPERSON (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Order! I apologise for interrupting the member, but I have let him go now for about 3 minutes and I want to remind him that we are on the Committee stage of the bill. The bill has been accepted in its current form and principle, and all we are trying to do is make sure that the detail is actually consistent with the principles accepted at the second reading. His speech was probably marginal for a second reading one, but it is certainly not good for the Committee. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Clayton </strong><strong>Cosgrove</strong>: Point of order—</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The</strong><strong> CHAIRPERSON (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: I am still on my feet, Mr Cosgrove. What I am going to ask the member to do now is to stick to the detail of the bill.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Chairperson. I do not wish to challenge your—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The</strong><strong> CHAIRPERSON (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: You had better not be.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Hon Clayton </strong><strong>Cosgrove</strong>: I know you too well to do that, in a lot of ways. But one thing I would say about the member's speech is that it is a very unusual situation that we face in the Committee in that a proposition was put forward by the Government and then reversed. There was an extreme amount of conjecture around that, some extremely flimsy analysis around it, and part of, as you say, checking the accuracy or the detail in the Committee stage—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The</strong><strong> CHAIRPERSON (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: OK; thank you. I have heard enough. </p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Dr DAVID </strong><strong>CLARK</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chair. Let me read from new Part 6, inserted by clause 6: "The purpose of this Part is to regulate the provision of patent attorney services by giving effect to the joint registration regime in accordance with the Arrangement." That is precisely the issue. Does this bill really give effect to a joint registration regime in the way that it was intended when the bill was lodged with the House? I do not think it does anymore. That is what I am arguing. I think the bill has changed in such a fashion that I am questioning whether it really achieves the original purpose put forward by the Minister, and I would appreciate his response on that. </p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 20:52:31" ></a><strong>Hon PAUL GOLDSMITH (Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs)</strong>: Thank you very much for the interventions by the previous two members, David Clark and Clayton Cosgrove. I should not have to explain to the previous speaker, David Clark, why he is here. I do not know why he is here myself. But the purpose of this bill is a very clear one, and that is to introduce a modern licensing regime for the patent attorneys. There seems to have been a great deal of confusion on the other side where it has conflated two different elements of the bill.</p><p class="a">The fundamental part of the bill is to introduce a trans-Tasman licensing regime for patent attorneys because the one that we have been operating under for a number of decades does not have some basic elements, such as a code of conduct, any disciplinary regime, and all the sorts of things that we would normally expect to be part of a licensing regime.</p><p class="a">As has been mentioned, the idea in the trans-Tasman setting with the agreement between the two Prime Ministers was to introduce that trans-Tasman regime as part of the broader single economic market that we have been making good progress towards. The idea of that is to have a quality patent attorneys industry across the Tasman so that New Zealand businesses can protect their intellectual property more effectively.</p><p class="a">The two elements that they—my friends across the other side of the Chamber—keep on referring to relate to the single patent application and the single examination processes. These were two processes. When this was introduced—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Dr David </strong><strong>Clark</strong>: This is the main substance of the bill.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon PAUL </strong><strong>GOLDSMITH</strong>: No. It is not the main substance; it was one of the substances. The primary substance of the bill was introducing a patent registration regime. If I could relate the history for the benefit of the members, when the bill was introduced to the House in November 2015, it included the proposition that it was a bespoke trans-Tasman single patent application and examination process.</p><p class="a">Running parallel to that had been a long, ongoing conversation at the World Intellectual Property Organisation, the WIPO level, to develop an international examination process called the Electronic Patent Cooperation Treaty (ePCT) system. There was a great deal of uncertainty as to whether or not that would actually occur. So when we introduced the bill we included the trans-Tasman operation as a good way of operating, but we were also conscious of the fact that it was possible that an international regime could come along and supersede it. That, indeed, is what has happened subsequent to the bill's introduction. In June this year—to the surprise of many, actually—the WIPO ePCT system had been concluded and had general agreement around that. So the rational thing to do, given that development, was to say that it no longer makes sense to try to develop a bespoke trans-Tasman single examination process when we can achieve the same thing at an international level.</p><p class="a">We got very strong feedback through the process, and that is why that part of the bill has been withdrawn. We are left with a bill that does a very effective job, I believe, in drawing together a trans-Tasman patent regime for the registration of patent attorneys. I do welcome the broad support that this bill has across the Committee. I do welcome the contribution from the member Mr Cosgrove to say that there is no politics in patents, and I think we should keep it that way. Thank you very much.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 20:56:49" ></a><strong>BARRY COATES (Green)</strong>: I rise to address the bill, and I am very aware that Part 1 of the bill has undertaken substantial change. I think we would not entirely agree with the rather optimistic view expressed by the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. </p><p class="a">Certainly, from our perspective, the starting point for this bill was a political announcement between Prime Ministers Key and Rudd in August 2009, and that political announcement, we think, was not well thought through in terms of the practicalities. It was followed in November 2011 by Cabinet's so-called regulatory framework, and we think that provided, again, an inadequate starting point for the development of the bill. </p><p class="a">Combined with a poor process and a lack of consultation, the bill that was presented to the Commerce Committee needed considerable work, and I think it is to the credit of the committee that there has been a new proposal that has now been brought back to the House with a withdrawn single patent application and withdrawn single patent examination process. We do support the fact that those elements have been dropped from the bill. </p><p class="a">We also note that there is retrospective legislation here. Retrospective legislation should be very much a last resort and should not, by any means, be a regular occurrence. We are aware that there were failings in the past in not considering the implications of the 2013 legislation carefully enough. </p><p class="a">With regard to Part 2 and the proposal for the trans-Tasman licensing regime for patent attorneys, we do agree with the need to modernise and update the original framework agreed under the Patents Act 1953—it is no longer fit for purpose—but we notice that the proposal in the bill was opposed by all 13 submissions from patent attorneys, as well as a submission from Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare. We think that joined-up thinking and a more complete examination of this issue would have put key elements in place before this legislation—for example, the New Zealand trademark attorney scheme, a New Zealand qualification scheme for attorneys, and an extended period for New Zealand attorneys to register in Australia.</p><p class="a">We think that, to some extent, the legislation has been put in place without those elements there that should, in fact, be there for the system to work to the advantage of New Zealand patent attorneys. We would urge the Government to put those pieces in place as quickly as possible. That will help defray some of the additional costs that are of obvious concern—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The</strong><strong> CHAIRPERSON (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Order! I am going to refer—the member sits down when I stand up—members to Speakers' ruling 52/2, dating back to 1931, which makes it clear that "Members must confine their remarks to the bill before the House and cannot make irrelevant matters relevant by suggesting they [should] be included in the bill."</p><p class="a">So what we are debating now is the bill we have got, not other matters. The member has been going for 4 minutes and, I think, at least half his speech could have been regarded as being irrelevant. So that is a reminder.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>BARRY COATES</strong>: Thank you for your advice, Mr Chair. I will take your advice. With regard to the bill, we remain concerned about the governance arrangements—for example, New Zealand patent attorneys have to travel to Australia for disciplinary proceedings, and we consider that the New Zealand subcommittee to the governance committee would ensure that New Zealand issues are not lost in an Australian-dominated governance committee. </p><p class="a">However, despite some of these criticisms and our concern over parts of the bill, there are significant improvements that have been made during the committee stage. For that reason, we do support the bill as amended, and we commend this for agreement. Thank you.</p></div></body>

The feedback has been a process of asking the question: why are we actually here? It seems to echo some of the earlier contributions of members on this side of the Chamber.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon </strong><strong>Member</strong>: It's an existential question.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>FLETCHER TABUTEAU</strong>: It is an existential question for Mr Goldsmith. The reality is the legislation itself—I think, the Minister will acknowledge—came to the House in the first reading and then to the select committee in a flawed manner. It did not serve the purpose for which he intended. The committee had a great deal to say about that and a great deal to explore around why that was the case. The feedback from the New Zealand First member was that the to-ing and fro-ing with MPs and officials was such that the select committee process probably failed the purpose for which it was intended, and that is the question I raise in the House tonight. Listening to other contributions tonight, you are not achieving what you set out to achieve. If there are any gains, they are minimal. </p><p class="a">Reading submissions in preparation for my contribution this evening seems to suggest—and I am loath to read them out because this is not in the bill, but it is what should be in the bill.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The</strong><strong> CHAIRPERSON (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Well, do not read those out.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>FLETCHER TABUTEAU</strong>: So I am well advised not to read those submissions out. Thank you, Mr Chair. </p><p class="a">What I will acknowledge is that new Part 1, new section 92(4)—which seeks to remove the right to operate a grant of patent on the grounds of a claim or claims related to one or more inventions—seems to have been supported by the committee and submitters. But, essentially, from then on—around the single patents application process, the single patent examination process, then Part 2, clause 6, where all 13 submissions opposed the implementation of the joint regime—we have come to a point where I suggest, respectfully, to the Minister, that he and his officials need to take this back for due and thoughtful consideration, because, I submit, it is not achieving what he set out to do. </p><p class="a">It is a short contribution, but it is a sincere one. I hope the Minister takes what we have to say into consideration. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 21:04:45" ></a><strong>CLARE CURRAN (Labour—Dunedin South)</strong>: We, the Opposition on the Commerce Committee, actually did the Government a huge favour with this piece of legislation. Minister Goldsmith should actually be getting up and thanking us, because what could have come back to the House was the bill in its original form. If it had come back to the House in its original form, then that Minister would have had to introduce, embarrassingly, a major Supplementary Order Paper to remove the substance of the bill because it was shown to be so woeful. </p><p class="a">In our minority report on this bill, we described the whole process as unedifying and sloppy, and that is being kind. As my colleague David Clark has pointed out, what we were given was a piece of legislation that was somebody's bright idea, which had not been tested, and, in fact, was acknowledged during the select committee process as being—and this is the single patent examination process (SEP) and the single patent application process (SAP) for patent registration—a pilot. </p><p class="a">As my colleague Clayton Cosgrove has pointed out, there was no cost-benefit analysis, and, in fact, nobody wanted it. The reason nobody wanted it was that it was going to cost the industry more. When I went and talked to the innovators—because they are actually the ones wanting to register patents—about the impact of this, none of them had been consulted. Secondly, all they wanted to know was whether this was going to take more time and whether it was going to cost more. The answer, essentially, was yes. </p><p class="a">The problem was that this Minister had not done his work. He had not done the due diligence before this bill came to the House for its first reading. There had been no testing of the principles behind it. I do not even know whether he had read it. That become patently obvious—see what I did there—as we went through the select committee process, because the officials had to go back to the Minister not once, not twice, not three times, not four times, not even five times but six times during the select committee process—six times. Do you know how we know that? Because we had to drag it out of them as to what was going on and how on earth we had got ourselves into this situation. We had to write to the Australians. We had to find out what process had been gone through.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Clayton </strong><strong>Cosgrove</strong>: Don't forget the confidential documents.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CLARE CURRAN</strong>: Oh, yes. There were confidential documents, but we cannot talk about them. Mr Chair, this is so relevant because this is why the SAP and the SEP—which are major substances of this piece of legislation that none of the submitters wanted and that the industry affected had not even been consulted on—was not effective. We discovered that there already was an international process being developed that superseded this and, really, it was not going to work at all, and that is why it had to be dumped. </p><p class="a">So we did the Government a favour by doing the responsible thing, behaving like a select committee should, working together, and actually saying that this really should go. That Minister really should get up and thank us, and next time he puts a piece of legislation to the House for a first reading, could he please read it and could he test with officials whether or not it has got sound principles so that we do not waste everybody's time, and probably a lot of money, and end up with what really is a pretty minimal and pretty embarrassing piece of law.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 21:09:35" ></a><strong>Hon CLAYTON COSGROVE (Labour)</strong>: I just want to revisit some of the questions I asked the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs because, with respect, they were not answered. Fundamentally, what Labour members and other colleagues who have taken calls want to know—because we could not get it out of officials—is whether this bill will work given the reversal of the primary Government proposition. For instance, if we look at page 2 of the commentary it talks about, given the reversal, the "Lack of benefits either to businesses or to patent attorney firms making applications on their behalf:". It talks about "Increased administrative costs to New Zealand businesses:". It talks about on the following bullet point "Significant costs". </p><p class="a">Then we go to consultation and quantifications of cost. "We consider that there was a lack of"—this was the Commerce Committee's report, Minister—"consultation with patent attorneys and the rest of the industry before the development and proposal of these enabling provisions. Moreover, we consider that quantification of likely costs—that is, the costs of developing and implementing these processes, and the compliance costs to the industry and patent applicants—was inadequate." </p><p class="a">My simple question is, as we posed in the Labour minority view, given that there was no cost-benefit analysis done or demonstrated, unless one accepts that the notion of "back of envelope" and "best guess"—I am trying to think of the figure that was given to us but, forgive me, I cannot remember—is appropriate cost-benefit analysis, and I am just going to take a short call, is can the Minister give the industry, and by that I mean the innovators, not the patent attorneys, the innovators; not those who charge fees, but the innovators who need intellectual property protection, an assurance that this reversal will work to their benefit? If the answer to that question is yes, could he demonstrate that by quantifying a cost-benefit analysis, which I assume his officials will now have done, now it is some weeks that it has been from the select committee process? </p><p class="a">Could he quantify that, and could he tell us what the benefit of this reversal will be? Because, as other colleagues have said, we are supporting it. We supported the original proposition, it was reversed, and we are supporting this proposition because we want to see this legislation work for the benefit of the innovators. But we remain—and we have made this clear in our minority view—none the wiser, with respect, and it is a rather unusual legislative position to be in where legislators will go through a process, support legislation, but still have a major question mark as to whether the rationale that they were presented with was so flimsy, such that it was, that it will actually give effect to the intent of the legislation. </p><p class="a">So we simply seek assurances around its effectiveness. And if the answer is yes, it will be effective for that innovative industry, those entrepreneurs, then can that be demonstrated? Can some evidence be provided in respect of quantification of costs and benefits? I think that is a reasonable, non-political request to make, and I am sure all the constituencies in the sector will be grateful for those assurances by the Minister.</p></div></body>

I want to begin this third reading debate by acknowledging again the work of the Primary Production Committee on this technical but important bill. The Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Amendment Bill will extend, expand, and clarify data protection in the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act 1997 and the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996. </p><p class="a">Data protection is how Government agencies use and safeguard the data that is supplied to them as part of applications to register agricultural compounds and veterinary medicines. Data protection rules prevent agencies from using the data provided by a previous applicant to assess subsequent applications to register similar products for the duration of a protected period. This is achieved, however, without stopping third parties from generating their own data and registering a competing product. </p><p class="a">In bringing this bill to the House my objective is to support primary industries' productivity and international competitiveness by encouraging the registration in New Zealand of new agricultural compounds and veterinary medicines (ACVM) products and new uses for existing products. However, I want to ensure that this is done in such a way that we do not inhibit competition in our ACVM product markets. </p><p class="a">The revised bill before you is very different from the version introduced. The Primary Production Committee recommended a number of changes to the bill in response to submissions by users and suppliers of agricultural compounds. As I said in the second reading speech, the revised bill is a balanced approach. It is balancing the issues raised by submitters, and I thank the members of the committee for their diligence. The changes definitely improve the bill. The bill will make a number of revisions to the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act, and for innovative products, including new uses, the bill is going to extend the data protection to 10 years and simplify how the data protection is actually applied. For non-innovative products, including reformulations and new uses, the bill is introducing data protection of 5 years. For data supplied as part of reassessments the bill introduces 5 years' data protection. </p><p class="a">The bill also clarifies and expands what qualifies as a new use. Under the bill, applications would qualify for data protection if they result in a product being used on an additional species of plant or animal, or a new pest or disease, or if they allow different application rates, methods, or withholding periods. Although those changes seem pretty technical in nature they are very important to our primary industries. Data protection provides time for suppliers of agricultural compounds to recoup the cost of developing the data to support the registration application. </p><p class="a">In terms of the benefits, the bill creates the right incentives for suppliers of agricultural compounds to invest in developing the data. This data is required by the regulators, as well as the data needed to support any reassessments. I am confident that suppliers will respond positively and that we will see more of the innovative products being brought to our market. We will also see good products stay on the market after reassessments, and products that will be registered for a wider range or broader array of uses to help our smaller sectors. </p><p class="a">The benefits of this for users of agricultural compounds are going to be higher investment in research and development, and increased primary industry productivity and international competitiveness. This is particularly important for the smaller sectors. There will also be better pest and disease management, and lower pesticide and antimicrobial resistance. There will be reduced risk to the environment, food safety, trade, animal welfare, and workers as we aim to phase out unsuitable products. Finally, there will be stronger supply side competition as substitute products are introduced to the market over time to compete with the registered products.</p><p class="a">I would like to thank the Primary Production Committee again, and also the submitters who took time to submit on the bill. I think this is an improved piece of legislation that will deliver benefits to our primary industries and, in doing so, to New Zealand. I commend the bill to the House.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 21:20:45" ></a><strong>Hon DAMIEN O'CONNOR (Labour—West Coast - Tasman)</strong>: I was talking briefly to a constituent tonight, just before I came down, and he said: "Go down and give the Government heaps." It is going to be difficult, because we do agree with the Government on this piece of legislation, and it nice to see Minister Goodhew acknowledge the good work that the Primary Production Committee did to improve a bill. </p><p class="a">I have said before in speeches in the House that this is a bill to protect New Zealand farmers and primary industry producers from ourselves. It is about innovation, and we are very, very good at that. So what has happened over the years is that we have had agricultural chemicals and compounds, they have been designed and developed for a certain purpose, and then, in the good old Kiwi way, farmers have taken that product and said "Well, that might be good somewhere else.", and they have applied it. But, in the new world of traceability and of maximum residue levels and accountability and registration, that is simply not good enough.</p><p class="a">The Minister has said that this bill is designed to do a couple of things—not to inhibit competition. The Government still believes that competition delivers nirvana to everything and everyone. It does wake up occasionally to the fact that, actually—through some good regulation and good law—when we have controlled competition and robust commercial activity, we often get a far better outcome. </p><p class="a">The bill is a balanced piece of legislation that does allow for the protection of data—of course, people may be confused: it is basically information that is gathered to show that a chemical works and is not harmful when it is applied to a particular crop or use and is not harmful to the crop or the animal and does not hang around to be harmful to anyone in the food that might be consumed from that. So companies put a lot of money into that science and into the information that then gets provided to Agcarm for registration of the product to say what it is used for, what the rates that should be applied are, and that, if done correctly, it will offer no harm to the environment or to the animal or to the crop or to the consumers of the products. </p><p class="a">We, as a country, must uphold those core principles absolutely. There should be no doubt that any food produced in this country is indeed the safest, best, and purest food that people can consume around the world. The premium that we should be getting for that should enable farmers to maintain their viability into the future. </p><p class="a">This piece of legislation is timely. I have got here a report done by Covec—you know, another one of the consultancy agencies that the Government is often happy to throw money at. It was done in February 2009, and, in fact, it has taken a long, long time now—2016; it is almost the end of it—for the Government to get off its butt and get around to actually implementing the recommendations here.</p><p class="a">A lot of people in the chemical industry and the industry supplying goods for the agricultural sector have probably been frustrated. They will be pleased to see the third reading of this bill go through the House, and I am certainly not going to delay that any longer than necessary. Mr Assistant Speaker, you will be pleased to hear that. </p><p class="a">Can I just say that we support the Government bringing the bill to the House, finally. The select committee has done the best job we possibly can. It is a balanced bill between protecting the information supplied by companies, but leaving the door open for innovation and for the development of new products. So I think this will be a good bill for agribusiness moving forward, and I hope that it is implemented, used wisely, and does, indeed, protect New Zealand's reputation as the producer of the finest food and fibre for the most discerning customers in the wider world. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 21:25:06" ></a><strong>IAN </strong><strong>McKELVIE</strong><strong> (National—</strong><strong>Rangitīkei</strong><strong>)</strong>: It gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak in the third reading of the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Amendment Bill. As has already been said tonight, it is a bill that has been a little while in the making, but it is a very important bill for New Zealand agriculture because it gives us the opportunity, I guess, to become more innovative than we have been and to get access to some modern and innovative products that have not been available on the New Zealand market to date. It also gives companies the opportunity to protect those products for a little longer, and that is the reason they will be available in the market place. As well as that, it also gives us the opportunity to use products for different uses than we have to date. This legislation enables companies to protect that data for a little longer as they change the use of those products from one use to another. </p><p class="a">So it is a pretty important bill for agriculture in New Zealand, and it gives us a really good opportunity, I think, to rid the country of a large number of chemicals that are well out of date. The reason it gives us the opportunity to rid the country of those chemicals is that there are much better, newer, and more innovative animal remedies and what we would know, I suppose, as chemicals, primarily around weed control and things like that—there are all sorts of pest controls—on the market in other parts of the world than there are in New Zealand, and this bill will enable those to come to New Zealand. So I think it is quite exciting for New Zealand. It gives us the opportunity, as I said, to become more innovative, and it will clean up a lot of the old chemicals around. </p><p class="a">For quite some years now companies have been stating that the amount of protection they get on bringing a new chemical into the country is not adequate to enable them to go through the cost structure. So the cost structure is too high for the short-term time frame they can protect that data, and, consequently, because our market is so small, it is not really economic for them to bring that product to New Zealand to make it available to our farmers. </p><p class="a">The Primary Production Committee had some interesting debates on this and, as often happens on our select committee, we ventured into discussion on all sorts of other things, from food safety, to food labelling, to country of origin, to Monsanto, which is one of our favourite topics, actually. Fortunately, our select committee staff are very tolerant of us, and they do put up with some quite wide-ranging discussions on these topics that we have in the course of the select committee meetings. But out of that discussion comes some interesting stuff, and I think it really just emphasises the fact that we need to create opportunities for new and modern, innovative products to come to New Zealand in order to eliminate some of the older ones we have. </p><p class="a">So—like the previous speaker, Damien O'Connor—I am not going to take too long on this contribution, but I do want to congratulate the Minister, Jo Goodhew, on bringing this bill to the House. I think, as I said, it is a necessary bill and it will do a great job. We did have great discussion on the select committee. We did not reach full agreement, and the Greens have inserted what I would consider to be an extraordinary minority view, appended to the bill, which is almost bigger than the report itself. But, none the less, that is how we live in our select committee and it works pretty well for us. </p><p class="a">So it gives me pleasure to support this bill as it goes forward. I think we have had adequate discussion, both in the select committee and in the House, on where this bill is going to take us and where it is going to take agriculture in the future. It will improve our opportunity, I guess, to get rid of some historic chemicals, and it will also improve farmers' opportunities to make a great deal of progress using new generation products. So I have got no problem commending this bill to the House and thanking the select committee for the hard work it did on the discussion on it. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 21:29:27" ></a><strong>RINO TIRIKATENE (Labour—Te Tai Tonga)</strong>: Kia ora, Mr Assistant Speaker. I am pleased to speak at the third reading of this bill, the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Amendment Bill. Yes, this is a technical bill, but the essence of it is that we have listened to all of the submitters, who unanimously encouraged the Primary Production Committee to extend the data-protection periods. We listened carefully to those submitters and, acting as a committee, we implemented those changes, and I think we have come to a bill that is going to be welcomed by our agricultural and horticultural sectors, and also the suppliers of agricultural compounds, agrichemicals, and veterinary medicines alike. </p><p class="a">This is an example of the select committee working together and crafting the piece of legislation and improving it. I believe that what we have done is strike a balance. I believe we have struck a better balance, because, clearly, the data-protection periods from the incumbent piece of legislation and even the initial bill that was proposed were inadequate. They were inadequate and, therefore, the industries were asking our committee and asking Parliament to give greater consideration and more extension to those periods. So we have done that. </p><p class="a">We have done that, and why have we done that? We want to make sure that those companies get an extended period of protection that allows them to recover their upfront investments into research and supplying highly technical, confidential information that they have to supply with their applications for registration of these products. The changes enable them to recoup that investment that they make. But also we are not into creating monopolies. We do not want this protection to be unlimited, but we have set a fair duration for all the different categories of applications that are provided under the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act. </p><p class="a">We have struck that balance, and why do we want to do that? We want to ensure that there are opportunities and incentives for the suppliers of these products to actually submit new registrations, new uses, and new reformulations to other parts of our agricultural industries. So this bill will encourage those registrations to, hopefully, be flooding in thick and fast so we can help broaden and deepen our productive sectors, our primary sectors, and grow the wealth and grow the productivity of our beautiful country and our export sectors. This is, I believe—and as previous speakers have said—about us striking the right balance. </p><p class="a">We do want to see those new products come into the market and come into the registration process. That will benefit new fledgling industries, particularly in our smaller niche product areas. Many—in fact, the vast majority—of the products that are registered have a very, very small customer base, and so there is a lot of upfront investment required in the business case. Without that protection, it is hard for those suppliers to make that business case work. So with this bill we do want to encourage a greater variety of new products to be coming forth, provide more protection for our plants and more treatments for animals, and to increase the productivity of our primary sectors, primarily. </p><p class="a">This is a big market that we are talking about too. Although we are a major producer in Aotearoa, we are talking about over half a billion dollars' worth of agricultural products and veterinary medicines. That is not an insubstantial number—over half a billion dollars—and as for our sheep and beef farmers and the on-farm costs, Mr McKelvie would be well aware of the costs that are involved as a percentage of the on-farm costs that these products create. There are a lot of these products, but only a small amount of them have very large turnover, large sales. The vast majority of them are very small niche products and, therefore, they do need that extra protection, and also the encouragement of new applications and new registrations to come through so we can meet the needs of our horticultural and agricultural sectors. </p><p class="a">So, with that, I will not prolong my contribution, but I do commend the work that we have done as a committee. We have crafted a fine piece of legislation here, and I am sure it will be to the benefit of our farmers and our horticultural producers right throughout the country, and I commend it to the House.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 21:35:33" ></a><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: The question is—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Steffan </strong><strong>Browning</strong>: I thought we were having another National Party one.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>The</strong><strong> ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Is the member calling?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Steffan </strong><strong>Browning</strong>: Yes, I am, Mr Assistant Speaker.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>The</strong><strong> ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Steffan Browning.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 21:35:46" ></a><strong>STEFFAN BROWNING (Green)</strong>: I would like to speak on the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Amendment Bill. I am very disappointed that a bit more rigour has not been put to the bill by the Government and some of the other Opposition parties as well. This bill is openly aiming to encourage more pesticides into New Zealand and with double the length of secrecy around those compounds. I call it a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP agreement) bill, and the reason I do that is that this bill started off extending the data protection from 5 years, year on year on year—in three stages—for new uses, up to 8 years. When that was announced last year, I thought "Mmm, that sounds like the Pharmac issue around the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.", and I looked at that and identified it as that. But it got worse. </p><p class="a">When the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was agreed and signed, effectively, earlier in the year, it had made a 10-year period of data protection for agricultural compounds and veterinary medicines (ACVM). We identified that with the officials. They fudged for a bit and said "No, no, we're not sure what's in the TPPA."—it was very straightforward, it was very easy—and then, sure enough, it has come through to 10 years' data protection. </p><p class="a">That is 10 years where civil society, interested parties in the community, people who really care about the health of New Zealanders and the environment cannot get the information about the formulations in these compounds—10 years. How many of those will need to be reassessed and withdrawn, even in that time—or should have been? We cannot rely on our Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI). It is interested in production; it does not care about the tool. It does not care, it seems, whether people are being exposed to endocrine disrupters that are affecting our children's hormonal development. It does not seem to care about the rising cancer rates that are so prevalent throughout New Zealand, particularly in the horticultural and agricultural areas. We have our own universities doing research and showing the prevalence and the increased rate of these sorts of diseases amongst the workers, particularly women, in horticulture, where they appear to be exposed to these pesticides. </p><p class="a">But what is happening? We cover it up. We say: "Bring in more and tell us less." Eleven hundred new ACVM compounds were registered since 2008, since this Government has been in, and only 239 were cancelled or expired. I am holding the fine print—these are the thousands of pesticides and agricultural compounds and veterinary medicines are already registered. What do we need more for? Do we need a plethora of more things when we are not even managing what is out there? </p><p class="a">Other countries, progressive countries, are doing pesticide reduction strategies. They are not cranking up. They are not trying to find ways to bring in more and then to hide what the hell is in them. I did an amendment to this, but, of course, it got voted down. It was to make sure that all applications for new or altered compounds be assessed in the full formulation as used—as used; as the community, the farmer, the worker, the animals, and the environment are exposed to. So many of these are not assessed. They are generally assessed with industry science, which you could assume is partially biased or at least edited, and not the full formulation as it should be tested—actually tested and not just fiddled about with—"Look at this compound maybe, or that." </p><p class="a">I did bring up in a previous speech that one of the main additives in many of the glyphosate products—it is in 69 of the 91 registered—is banned in Europe. The European Commission has banned it, and we cannot even find out, because of this sort of damned law, which one it is. Someone who may even think that glyphosate-based herbicides are OK cannot find out which ones have got polyoxyethylene tallow amine in them, which has been found to be even more toxic than the base ingredient, glyphosate. They cannot find that out because of this bill. </p><p class="a">Unfortunately, most of this House, apart from the Greens and the Māori Party, are ticking it through. It is appalling. Can we rely on MPI? No, we cannot. Can we rely on the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA)? No, we cannot. I use a primary example with the EPA. Because of the pressure on glyphosate and the issues that are going, especially through Europe—and we should be very cognisant of that, as an exporting country that relies on clean, unadulterated food, and what consumers want—they do not want to have those traces in their food. The Environmental Protection Authority commissioned a paper to look at what the World Health Organization's (WHO) international agency for research on cancer had found—that glyphosate was a probable carcinogen. [<em>Interruption</em>] Seventeen world-class toxicologists—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The</strong><strong> ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Sorry—[<em>Interruption</em>] Order! I just ask the member to take a seat, and I am going to ask Mr Barclay to cease interjecting for the rest of this speech.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>STEFFAN BROWNING</strong>: Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. So this international agency, with highly reputable scientists, people who really, really know that subject, went through a multitude of papers, not just the industry papers. They looked at papers with full formulation, not just the ones with a sole ingredient, and they said it is a probable carcinogen. It should be off the shelves on that basis, but, of course, it does not suit us here in New Zealand. </p><p class="a">So what happens? The EPA commissions someone to reassess it. It gets one individual to reassess it, and then, of course, it edits it. We have looked at some of that editing, and we have also looked at what the Ministry of Health said about it. The Ministry of Health said: "What are you doing? What are you going down that strategy for, because even if you find it is different from the WHO, does that mean we cannot use all WHO stuff anymore?". The Ministry of Health and the Minister should take good note of that. The ministry warned the EPA, but the EPA still went down this track. </p><p class="a">That paper for the EPA discounted full-formulation science, invariably. It discounted more independent science, and it came to the conclusion that it probably was not a carcinogen—this one retired toxicologist from New Zealand against the 17, with all the influences from MPI and EPA to make sure he got the damn words right. Is that the sort of stuff we want for New Zealand—to come out with something that has no credibility in terms of science just so that we can do business as usual in New Zealand? It is appalling. </p><p class="a">The purpose of the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act is "to protect the environment, and the health and safety of people and communities, by preventing or managing the adverse effects of hazardous substances and new organisms." This bill does nothing of the sort. It leads us further down the track in this pathetic approach to pesticides in New Zealand. This pioneering country, in the old colonial style of rip, tear, and bust, and do whatever—with no precaution or care, it seems, for the health and safety of people and communities—will allow 10 years' data protection to meet the TPP agreement's requirements. That is what has happened here. </p><p class="a">The literature out there says that that particular herbicide—which I go on about so much, because it is a classic example—should be off shelves, and it certainly should be off the streets and parks of New Zealand. The Greens are certainly opposing this bill. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 21:45:33" ></a><strong> RICHARD PROSSER (NZ First)</strong>: I am pleased to rise on behalf of New Zealand First to take a final call in this third reading of the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Amendment Bill. New Zealand First supports this bill.</p><p class="a">There has been, and there continues to be, a degree of misunderstanding about what this bill actually is and what it does. What this bill does not deal with is patents or trademarks. It does not address the ownership of patented compounds or, indeed, the nature of those compounds. What this bill deals with is the data that is generated in the pursuit of the development of those compounds, not with the compounds themselves. It is not about patents; it is about the research that goes into creating patentable products. Products themselves can still be protected via the legislation, providing that the researcher or the developer—whoever it is who has created the compound or discovered the use for it—has the wherewithal to fund that patenting and trademarking process on an international scale.</p><p class="a">Nothing in this bill actually stands in the way of a third party doing their own research and recreating a particular compound. It does, however, prevent that third party from gaining access to the data that was used or generated in the development of the compound, or in the development of the innovative use for the compound, by the original inventor. Or, more to the point, it extends the protections that already exist from 5 years to 10 years, against the original change that the officials proposed, which was to go to 8 years.</p><p class="a">People have talked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and how this bill will be affected by it. The way that this bill is structured falls short of what the TPP would require, if, in fact, the TPP was going to happen—which, as we now know, it probably is not, certainly in its current form or time frame, depending on the outcome of the United States election. The bill's proposed 10-year protection is still conditional on new and innovative uses being registered for any given compound, rather than it being a blanket protection, as applies in Australia and some other parts of the world, and, indeed, as the TPP would require. So the advantage to New Zealand in extending the research protection is that it provides an additional incentive for companies to do their high-tech R &amp; D here, rather than anywhere else.</p><p class="a">My colleague Steffan Browning from the Greens raised the concern—well, he has raised it tonight, but he also raised it in the Primary Production Committee—that by passing this bill we are helping the likes of Monsanto and other evil empires to tighten their grip on the free peoples of the world, and, really, that is not the case. My point in response—and I will reiterate it here—is that there is a large and growing thrust in the world's wealthy and discerning markets towards organics and other foods that are produced without GE, without GM, and without the excessive use of kinds of agrichemicals, as we have come to consider them. Producing those foods, which is something that New Zealand does particularly well and which we are developing a reputation for—if we are going to do that on a large commercial scale, it will still require specialty compounds in order to maximise safe and efficient production. This bill will, in fact, make it easier for companies to develop such compounds, so you will have the likes of better compost-starter enzymes, better fatty acid herbicides, better <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> - carrier solutions, better soap-based fungicides, and all those sorts of things. It is not just a bill that protects chemical companies as we know them; it is a bill that gives additional protection to all manner of further ongoing agrichemical research, including into organics and GE-free.</p><p class="a">In extending the protections, it gives companies that are doing that sort of work an additional incentive to build their research labs here and carry out that work here—the research and the manufacturing—rather than doing it in California or Switzerland or somewhere else. I do not think it is going to be a bill that will enable evil corporations to give us three-eyed sheep, two-headed chickens, asparagus that glows in the dark, or anything else that we do not want.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Michael </strong><strong>Woodhouse</strong>: I love asparagus that glows in the dark.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>RICHARD PROSSER</strong>: Ha, ha! I have never seen asparagus that glows in the dark, Mr Woodhouse. I have seen a report about some pigs that glow in the dark—they were created in Japan. But that is a whole different story.</p><p class="a">When those companies do elect to do that research and manufacturing here in New Zealand, it is this country and our economy that benefit. We benefit through job creation, and that is everything from the construction sector—as it builds new labs and new factories—to attracting more of our best and brightest to universities to study the biological and physical sciences that are involved in the manufacture, the research, and the development of agricultural compounds and veterinary medicines. We keep more of those people here in New Zealand, because they can get the good, well-paying, career-advancing jobs that their qualifications then call for here in New Zealand, rather than having to go overseas to find that work.</p><p class="a">Small companies are also advantaged by these sorts of additional protections because they are the ones that are least able to gain additional protections through other means—they do not necessarily have the funding and the wherewithal behind them to go into international legal processes to get trademarks, patents, and so forth. This legislation is another mechanism by which we can extend those protections to them. It is a shot in the arm for the Kiwi inventor, the innovator, Kiwi ingenuity—No. 8 fencing wire—the guy working away quietly in his shed, and the independent researcher working away quietly in a lab somewhere who comes up with a brilliant idea. It is all part of the New Zealand story. It is those smaller operators who will benefit most from this kind of legislation.</p><p class="a">As things stand, when existing protections expire—we do have existing protections, and this bill is about extending them, rather than creating them—all the information that was discovered, and the data that was created that went along with the application to register it, becomes available to all and sundry. That means that, say, the "XYZ Company" from the United States or Germany or China or wherever has then got access to that data and can then use it to, essentially, duplicate the work that the original inventor did. They might come up with a slight change and come up with a different product. They themselves then have the wherewithal, in terms of scale, to manufacture larger quantities, to market globally, and, essentially, to pull the rug out from under the person in New Zealand who had the bright idea to start with.</p><p class="a">If somebody is in a position where they are doing that sort of research, be they an independent operator or a small company, they are much less likely to put that kind of time, effort, money, and resource into developing a new compound or into researching a new use for it if they know that, 5 years down the track, all the protection for that research that they have done—the blood, sweat, and tears that they have put into their hard toil; perhaps they mortgaged their house to fund it—can potentially be pulled away from them by some large corporation that has just been sitting and waiting for the protections to expire.</p><p class="a">At the same time, as other members have mentioned—I think Mr McKelvie mentioned it—companies based in other countries that have, in a similar manner, created new compounds or developed new uses for them will be able to bring their products to New Zealand knowing that they will have a similar, comparable degree of protection for that data here as they would have anywhere else. It means that by passing this bill, we give some surety to New Zealand farmers—to livestock farmers, to growers, and so forth—that they will be able to get access to the newest, latest, most cutting-edge, innovative products that are available overseas, because there is no disincentive for the foreign-based companies that create and manufacture these compounds to bring them here, as they know that they will have the same degree of protection.</p><p class="a">In closing, I would like to reiterate that, in some ways, we do not believe this bill goes far enough. It could have gone further, but it went at least as far as the majority of submitters from the industry asked for. That aside, we agree with the intentions of the bill. We believe that it is necessary and that it will bring advantages to this country. New Zealand First supports it, and I commend it to the House. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 21:53:31" ></a><strong>POTO WILLIAMS (Labour—Christchurch East)</strong>: It is not an area of expertise that I particularly hold—the primary industries area. However, I have had the opportunity to speak on this bill in several passages through the House. It has amazed me, actually, as a townie, to be part of the conversation and to actually understand the level of science and discussion that sits behind our farming industry. I think that members of the House should take the opportunity to engage in conversations across other areas where they may not necessarily have a high level of expertise. </p><p class="a">I was fascinated by this particular bill and the fact that the data can be used by those researchers to find new and different ways of using their products, whether it is around different species that can benefit from their products, or whether it is finding completely innovative ways to use these compounds or to add something to the formulations, which means that you can use these compounds in new and creative ways. It has been fascinating to be part of the discussion. </p><p class="a">As the previous speaker has said, we are a country of inventors. We take the No. 8 wire approach to many things. I think that really stands us in good stead. When we go overseas as members of Parliament and look at the ways that other countries' primary industries are structured and the types of data that they use to inform them and to support the work they do, we can see that as a small nation at the bottom of the world we do incredibly well. I guess part of it is the fact that our isolation has forced us to really look at different ways of working, different ways of using our research, and different ways of using the technology that we already have for a broader base of opportunities. </p><p class="a">I do want to comment too on what Richard Prosser said about data management. I know that we have some very strong tertiary education in terms of being able to use that data management and those processes in some incredibly diverse ways. I do not have the strength to be able to talk about this in any real depth. I do not actually have the knowledge that other members of the House have of the practical implications or the practical applications of this work. But it has fascinated me that we can take a formulation, we can recreate that for use across a range of species, or across a range of applications, and, with this piece of legislation, we can provide some protections for those people who actually create the information and the knowledge, so that they have some benefit from that. I know that I have got prime-time viewing but I will not hold up the passage of this bill. I commend it to the House. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161102 21:57:09" ></a><strong>EUGENIE SAGE (Green)</strong>: This will be a short call on the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Amendment Bill. The Green Party wants the primary sector to have access to the latest technology, both for plant protection and for animal health. But we are opposing this bill because we think it is weighted too heavily towards industry rather than the protection of the public. We want a New Zealand where there is greater use of integrated pest management, greater use of organics, and where there is greater public knowledge about the compounds that are being used to control pests and weeds. This bill, by extending the data protection, actually mitigates against that.</p><p class="a">Although Mr Prosser and others have talked a lot about the benefits of extending the secrecy around the compounds that are used in these products, because we do not have a robust assessment of pesticide use in New Zealand, by either the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) or the Environmental Protection Authority, we think there needs to be much greater transparency about what chemicals are being used. I also think that if you read the regulatory impact statement from the Ministry for Primary Industries, a lot of the claims that have been made about the commercial benefits of extending data protection are on somewhat shaky ground. The ministry made it very clear in the regulatory impact statement that there was no detailed information by which it could establish the extent to which the current regime and the current 5-year term for keeping information about the composition of these compounds secret resulted in new products or new uses not being registered, or the extent to which it inhibited the development of new products, using existing chemistry.</p><p class="a">When you have had MPI saying that a precise determination of the net economic impact of any changes is not possible, how can all these assertions be made that it will have significant economic benefits? We do not think it is appropriate that we have got legislation going through that will make the current regime less transparent by extending the periods for data protection, extending the non-disclosure periods, when you have got only some anecdotal information where the industry claims that the current rules have discouraged a product from being registered. It is interesting that the provisions in the current legislation go back to our obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. So, again, it seems to be where these big chemical companies, using international agreements, have influenced New Zealand legislation.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Debate interrupted.</p><p class="CentredEndingItalics"><em>Sitting suspended from 10 p.m. to 9 a.m. (Thursday)</em></p></div></body>
