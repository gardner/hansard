This bill gives effect to a deed of settlement between the Crown and Te Atiawa that was signed on a beautiful late winter's day in August 2014 in New Plymouth. The settlement comprises historical redress, which records the breaches and the past injustices caused by failures of the Crown; cultural redress, recognising the traditional historical cultural and spiritual association of the people of Te Atiawa with a number of their most culturally significant sites; and financial and commercial redress, reasserting the role of Te Atiawa in the region. </p><p class="a">For me, I want to acknowledge the excellent work of Te Atiawa negotiators, and I was so pleased, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you mentioned Wikitōria Keenan. The last time that I saw her was at the signing of the deed. She was unwell but made every effort to be there. I acknowledge my ministerial colleagues and Government and other agencies that have contributed to the bill, and I also want to acknowledge the work of the Māori Affairs Committee and its commitment to exploring very comprehensively the matters raised by submitters. </p><p class="a">The committee began its consideration of the bill in April this year, and it considered eight submissions from interested groups and individuals. The committee also heard oral evidence from five submitters at hearings in New Plymouth and Wellington. The committee has recommended that the bill be passed with a number of amendments, which include changes to clauses relating to fines for offences under regulations and by-laws; the addition of a subclause to ensure that nominations for iwi representation align with those in the Ngāruahine Claims Settlement Bill and the Taranaki Iwi Claims Settlement Bill; an amendment of the definition of "Taranaki Iwi" to include hapū to the extent that they are composed of individuals who no longer form distinct communities within Taranaki iwi; a self-repealing clause over the Waitara lands clause of the bill so that it is repealed on the same day that the Waitara Harbour Act and the Waitara Borough Reserves Vesting Act are repealed; and other minor technical amendments that are not specifically referred to in the committee's commentary on the bill. </p><p class="a">I want to say something about the Waitara lands, as well as other issues that the committee raised in its report. No one is in any doubt at all—especially after last night's debate—that the Waitara endowment lands are of huge cultural and spiritual importance to the people of Te Atiawa. The lands have been the subject of very intense negotiations between Te Atiawa and the Crown and the council over a number of years. In its commentary on the bill, the committee provided a useful summary of these negotiations and the resulting recommended amendments to the bill. The committee also notes its concern that the bill does not address all of the issues raised to it regarding the lands. </p><p class="a">During the final stages of the settlement bill, the New Plymouth District Council proposed a Waitara lands local bill. The local bill will, if enacted, render one aspect of the Treaty bill redundant. In light of the proposed local bill the committee recommended including a self-repealing clause within the settlement legislation to account for the local bill. My officials are going to take an active part in the select committee work on that local bill, which, as we know, was sent to the Māori Affairs Committee last night, and we look forward to working with the council and Te Atiawa to reach a durable outcome for all parties. </p><p class="a">Can I pay credit to the negotiators who have had to make some difficult decisions and significant concessions during settlement talks. This pragmatic approach and willingness to work with both the Crown and the local council has enabled a pathway forward that provides a realistic opportunity for the people of Te Atiawa to be involved in future consultation and negotiations that recognise their aspirations in relation to these lands. </p><p class="a">In its consideration of the bill the committee addressed the right-of-first-refusal land. Although the committee is not recommending any amendments to the bill in relation to the right-of-first-refusal list, it notes that some committee members considered there should be a mechanism in settlement legislation for land that becomes available at a future date to be offered back as a right of first refusal, even if it does not appear on the list. The difficulty here is that once a list is agreed and the deed signed it is subject to the overlapping claims process and being ratified by the claimant community. The Crown's objective is to achieve fair and durable settlements with groups. Ratification and the overlapping claims process ensures a balance is maintained between addressing the grievances of one group without creating further grievances for another group. To undo either of these key aspects of settlement negotiations risks unsettling the balance that is achieved at the negotiating table. </p><p class="a">This bill brings to an end many, many long years of negotiation between Te Atiawa and the Crown. The settlement is the end of a long journey that signals the beginning of a new journey into the settlement area, which I sincerely hope will be a new and improved relationship with the Crown and a time for peace and a time for looking to the future, and I believe it can be, if the Crown honours its undertakings and acts in accordance with Treaty principles. </p><p class="a">Before I commend the bill to the House I need to just say a few things about the events of the last few days. I will make these comments once only, rather than in each of today's second readings, because I am very disappointed it was not possible for these bills and the Ngāruahine Claims Settlement Bill to proceed to a third reading tomorrow. I was particularly looking forward to tomorrow for the iwi of Taranaki. </p><p class="a">I remember very well—and perhaps my good friend Mr Okeroa was there as well—Māui Pōmare Day of 2009 at Ōwae Marae. I think I startled a few of the Office of Treaty Settlements officials for going off message when I suggested that it would be great to enter into negotiations with the iwi of Taranaki. And I remember very well March 2010, when we signed the terms of negotiation in the morning at Puke Ariki with Te Atiawa, and then we went round to Taranaki's principal marae round the coast to sign the terms of negotiation in the afternoon. Ngāruahine came a little bit later. But since that time I have come to know these iwi very, very well, and I have huge respect and affection for these iwi and their leaders. They have some of the best iwi leaders in the country. I have also come to know their history. It really has been the education of a public man, learning about the Land Wars, learning about the horrors of Parihaka, and the sadness that so many people have experienced for far too long. </p><p class="a">There is much I could say, but I choose not to. These are very dignified occasions and it is not appropriate to descend into verbal slanging matches, particularly when we have guests in the gallery. What I do want to say to the iwi present today is that I am going to do my utmost to see that we have a third reading of these bills as soon as possible, and, as I have already communicated to the iwi, anyone who has suffered a loss as a result of the parliamentary actions over the last few days should contact the Office of Treaty Settlements. I am very disappointed, but to quote the line from that song in <em>Life of Brian</em>, "Always look on the bright side of life."—it was when those three were all being crucified, I think. We will get through a lot of work today and hopefully it is not going to be too long before we progress to third readings. I welcome our friends in the gallery, and I commend the bill to the House.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 09:15:48" ></a><strong>ADRIAN RURAWHE (Labour—Te Tai </strong><strong>Hauāuru</strong><strong>)</strong>: </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">I want to go straight into some specific issues within the Te Atiawa Claims Settlement Bill. I want to, first of all, take a couple of quotes from the bill itself around the acknowledgment and the apology. Within the settlement bill: "The Crown acknowledges that—(a) it unfairly treated Te Atiawa as being in rebellion; and (b) the confiscations of 1865 were indiscriminate in extent and application and had a devastating effect on the welfare, economy, culture, and social development of Te Atiawa;". It goes on, in the apology, to say: "The Crown is sorry for the immense prejudice it caused by confiscating the lands of Te Atiawa. The raupatu was indiscriminate, unjust, and unconscionable. The Crown deeply regrets the damage this caused to the economy and society of Te Atiawa." It is important that we remember that, in the context of the overall bill.</p><p class="a">Last night I spoke on the New Plymouth District Council (Waitara Lands) Bill in its first reading. One of the things that I spoke about too was the Waitara lands. I want to restate what I said in relation to that bill, here today on this bill. It is important that we acknowledge that this process of settlement is one that is flawed. It does not deliver everything that iwi would want it to deliver—it does not even pretend to do that. It is a negotiated settlement. It is not compensation; it is redress. It is incumbent upon each and every settlement group, each and every iwi that goes through this process, that it fully understands what the process can deliver and what it cannot deliver. And it is also incumbent on each settlement group to ask the big question: "Can we live with that?". In this instance I am absolutely certain that the negotiators would have asked themselves that question</p><p class="a">I refer to the Waitara lands—the confiscation of the Pekapeka Block—and the pain and anguish that people still carry today around that. The hapū of that area, Manukōrihi and Ōtaraua—members of those hapū still bear the burden of that trauma that happened in 1865. It is important also to note that the negotiators came up with an agreement with the Crown and signed that deed of settlement—the deed of settlement that is a binding document; the deed of settlement that outlines how Te Atiawa, on behalf of all of its hapū, wants to move forward. </p><p class="a">The clause within the bill, which is basically a voluntary clause around the ability for Te Atiawa to purchase the endowment lands at Waitara—that is a voluntary clause that is in the bill that gives the opportunity for Te Atiawa to purchase the lands from the district council. The bill that was introduced and read a first time last night will, as the Minister acknowledged, effectively, remove that. Within the bill, the recommendation from the Māori Affairs Committee was that there be an automatic repeal of that clause. Based on the bill that was read a first time last night, that basically makes those clauses redundant. So I think that it is important that that is in the mix in this discussion. </p><p class="a">I think that it is really important—taking in context the acknowledgment and the apology—that we do not add another layer of breach upon this current bill. That is a big question, and my challenge to all of the participating interests within this bill and the bill that was read a first time last night—it is absolutely, critically important that your compelling evidence is presented to the Māori Affairs Committee for it to be considered. I know that there are many people who are hurting about one or both of these bills. </p><p class="a">This is a process that needs to be inclusive. It needs to ensure that everyone, as much as possible, is on board with this settlement. The settlement needs to be enduring; it needs to last beyond several generations, for each generation that comes into the future. The reason why you would accept a redress that is considerably less than the total value of the loss—you would do it for the future generations. It is very important for this House to be confident that this settlement will endure, and to have a bill read for the first time that the entire Parliament agreed to. I think the important thing there is that it agreed to it so that everyone could have their say. From what I can tell from what everyone has said in this House about that bill: beyond select committee, there are no deals on this particular legislation. I think it should be noted that everyone should be clear about the process before us. </p><p class="a">There are a number of other issues that I do want to discuss. I know that the Committee stage is coming and there are a couple of areas that I do want to speak about, particularly on the right of first refusal and other matters.

I have tried. I have tried to chill my pill for the last couple of days, but there are some things in this bill that were well debated during the committee stages. Every single part of this bill has been negotiated by people who know more about it than I do. Every single part of this bill has been negotiated by the members of Te Atiawa and Taranaki with the Office of Treaty Settlements—with their Crown negotiators—and, I tell you, over the years of these settlements, you know, our people have got better at negotiating. We are pretty good at that sort of stuff. We have been negotiating for 175 years over how to have our rights observed in the law. </p><p class="a">The Crown has also got pretty good at negotiating, and that is why we have this debate about the right of first refusal (RFR). You know, when you look back at the Kāi Tahu settlement, they got a geographic RFR over practically the whole island—any land in the whole of Te Wai Pounamu that might come up at some time, just maybe. We have got an RFR—yay! The Crown has gotten better at that now, so now you have got to have a list: "Show me which bits of land you want." And then, when they found out when they went to go and purchase some land that, actually, the title was wrong, and they thought it was the council but it turned out to be the Government—well, we cannot guarantee that any list that is out there is going to be correct. </p><p class="a">So we debated long and hard over whether to have a geographic RFR as well as a list RFR, and can I say that the time has probably come for the whole RFR issue to be reviewed—the how and when. We have found out that, actually, there are a whole lot of stages before land gets offered back to iwi, if it is found to be available, and one of them is to offer it to a charity—a charity, any charity. It could be the "Fox Whānau Charity" or the "Looking After All Those Sick Kids in the Fox Whānau House Charity". It could get offered back to them first, before it is offered back to iwi, and I find that quite despicable. I do not see the point in that at all. So I think it is time to review it completely. </p><p class="a">However, all of those things were debated and negotiated by the whānau of Te Atiawa, one of whom you acknowledged this morning, Mr Deputy Speaker. But there is also Peter Moeahu, Wikitōria Keenan, Grant—ah, I am going to say that wrong—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon </strong><strong>Member</strong>: Knuckey.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MARAMA FOX</strong>: Knuckey—thank you. I was going to say "Kentucky", but, no—sorry, Grant. There is also Keith Holswich, Liana Poutū, and Hēmi Sundgren—I am sorry, I am really bad at Pākehā names. People mix me up with Marama Davidson all the time, so I sort of get it. </p><p class="a">But, you know, if I echo the words of Te Whiti o Rongomai, he would say that we celebrate the forbearance, the patience, the stout-heartedness of the iwi and their negotiators in getting to this point. If there was an issue, if there was a point to be made, or if there was something that through the first reading, the second reading, or the Committee stage needed to be talked about, then surely it could have gone back to them. </p><p class="a">Tomorrow we could have been celebrating a long, hard-fought win that started with the people of Atiawa being accused of treason, which started under the Suppression of Rebellion Act. It started because they did not fight against the Crown or the Crown's forces, but they simply fought for house and home and refused to sell their lands, and, in doing so, they were accused of treason under the Suppression of Rebellion Act and the soldiers were wheeled in. </p><p class="a">That is what we are talking about. All of those lands confiscated and people thrown unjustly into prison and held, killed, and taken, and after all of this time of trying to have that grievance settled, we come to the eleventh hour. This is why I am so upset. </p><p class="a">I do not care what little thing you might be pulling out to justify the stunt that was played in this House. Thirty years of negotiations—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Rt Hon Winston </strong><strong>Peters</strong>: This is showboating. We know more about this than you do.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MARAMA FOX</strong>: Is that right? Tell them that, because this is what I will tell you, Mr Peters. This is straight from the chairperson, Liana Poutū: "We were absolutely angry at the start, but now we are just disappointed."—[<em>Interruption</em>]—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</strong>: Order!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MARAMA FOX</strong>: —"More than that, New Zealand First have opposed the bill. What we're hearing is it's a technical thing, but we don't know much about it. The fact is their actions are disingenuous, and to pull not only our bill but five at such a late stage without any explanation to the iwi whose bills they are is really disingenuous and despicable. If they actually have a substantive issue that they are opposed to in the bill, I'd rather know about it, and I'd be happy for it to be pulled to sort that issue out. They've pulled it without fronting up to us at all, and the five busloads of people ready to go down there, and that's not easy—a logistical episode." </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Rt Hon Winston </strong><strong>Peters</strong>: Stop showboating. You pulled the bill.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MARAMA FOX</strong>: I did not. I objected. I want it known in the <em>Hansard</em> of this House that I objected to that day being cancelled, strongly. And I sent a message with your whip to tell you exactly—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Rt Hon Winston </strong><strong>Peters</strong>: So did we.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MARAMA FOX</strong>: You did not. Showboating and stunting you know very much about, Mr Peters.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</strong>: Order! Take a seat please, I say to the member. Let us just remember what we are doing here today. Members will have a chance to speak. Having a constant barrage across the House and then a response to that does not do anything for the dignity of what we are trying to do here today.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Rt Hon Winston Peters</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I respect that view, and so does my party, but this is a debate, and at this stage it cannot be a barrage or a rewriting of history, and abuse of another party, when we will demonstrate—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon </strong><strong>Members</strong>: How is this a point of order?</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Rt Hon Winston </strong><strong>Peters</strong>: We do not mind them raising it for just one or two sentences, but to turn it into a barrage is not going to be tolerated by us, because it is utterly false.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</strong>: I do not need any assistance in respect of that. The point that I made earlier was that the parties concerned will have their own speaking slot in which to state their case. Interjection is something that is part of a robust debate—that is fine—but let us just remember what we are doing here, and let us retain the decorum of the House.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>MARAMA FOX</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Yes, I take it—it is noted. I am going back to try to chill my pill again, because I do get a little bit upset about this, and I am reading not my words but the words of the chairman, who was also upset: "This potential delay is messing with people's livelihoods, their ability to move forward, and tantamount to a political party trampling on our mana." Not my words—their words. </p><p class="a">So we come back to the issue of the bill. We are here to support the passage of this bill through the House so that we can move on, so that the whānau of Te Atiawa can finally be able to have that redress recognised, so that they can finally have the opportunity to correct the imbalance that continues to exist, and so that they can finally take hold of the reins of rangatiratanga—supported through the redress of the Crown, both cultural and financial—and move on and move past, and offer back to the country what we have all recognised is one of the biggest koha to this country of Māoridom. It is one of the largest koha to this country of Māoridom to accept such a pittance—to accept such a pittance—for the great injustice that was carried out first here, and then around the rest of the country. </p><p class="a">And to our whānau, I feel the weight of it. This is not the made-up, crocodile-tear grandstanding that we are accused of, because we feel the weight of it—the weight of the injustice. Your time is here, and I wish that it could be settled tomorrow, but we will have to wait. But we have waited such a long time, we are resilient and strong people, and we can wait a little bit longer. Tēnā koe, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 09:36:41" ></a><strong>CATHERINE DELAHUNTY (Green)</strong>: </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">I would just like to stand and acknowledge the manuhiri who have come, the importance of this day, and the importance of what we are in the process of doing. I would like to acknowledge the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations and the work of the Māori Affairs Committee on this important day. I am standing here for the first time on this bill, although this is its second reading. As the previous speaker, Marama Fox, said, I also feel a weight—the weight of history that comes from what happened in Te Atiawa, and what that means to our nation. The shame I feel that so many people for so long have not understood the significance of what happened in Taranaki, in Te Atiawa, as the beginning of the total dispossession of tangata whenua across the motu—when the colonial forces decided to take the land. So I think it is very important for us to acknowledge today the weight of history, the importance of trying to do better, and, in many ways, to express to Te Atiawa that Parliament may not yet have grown up, but you grew up a long time ago—you had no choice. We need to honour that. We need to honour your effort and respond to your effort with equal respect.</p><p class="a">I just want to talk also about the way in which war, perpetual leases, and other mechanisms have been tools of alienation of land in Te Atiawa rohe, and how profoundly devious, as well as direct, the process of colonisation is. I am using the word "is", because I do not actually think it is over. I think this is a positive step in the right direction—a controversial and positive and difficult step in the right direction—but it is not over. The Green Party always stands to pay respect to the bill—we will be supporting it—but we also stand to pay respect to the fact that Te Tiriti o Waitangi, which was signed by Te Atiawa tupuna, does not finish. It cannot be full and final; it must be an ongoing relationship. It must be an ongoing dialogue. It does not end this day. I believe, and the Green Party believes, that we would always stand here to hear more from Te Atiawa, from the hapū katoa, about these issues. It is not over for us, because we stand for Te Tiriti, and that is about a permanent, ongoing, negotiated relationship based on justice.</p><p class="a">I would like to also acknowledge that part of the loss is in the 20th century—the 1944 Act where the Crown attempted to say that it had compensated and recognised Te Atiawa, without the consent of Te Atiawa. That is what I meant by devious: the ongoing pretence that things have been settled in the past, right through the 20th century.</p><p class="a">I acknowledge too that it is not only the physical loss to the people of their whenua but also the pollution issues that have affected Te Atiawa. The Waitara River that has been treated like a drain by a number of industries and by the sewage of the communities—this food source, this taonga, that leads out to a food basket and the struggle that there has been, the intergenerational struggle, to clean up that river. The relationship that Te Atiawa has with the coast and their connection to Ngā Motu is acknowledged in the settlement—yet the Dow Chemical Co. polluted that community, polluted that area with a toxic product that was sprayed over Vietnamese people, that was generated in Taranaki, and where the sick people are still affected and the environment is still affected. I want to acknowledge Te Atiawa's burden that they have received, through no fault of their own, from the abuse of land, the abuse of the colonisation process, and then the abuse of the environment, which they cannot separate themselves from and would not wish to.</p><p class="a">This is not an uncontroversial settlement, and hapū such as Manukōrihi and Ōtaraua are expressing concerns. Unfortunately, when the Crown dictates the terms it puts iwi in a tight box about who is a large natural grouping—who gets heard, who does not—and I acknowledge the best efforts of everyone and the ongoing issues.</p><p class="a">Last night I had the privilege of speaking on the New Plymouth District Council (Waitara Lands) Bill, the local bill, and, as others have said, our support for it to go to select committee is extremely constrained. We will not be guaranteeing any further support, because that local bill is not a Treaty settlement but it deals with Te Tiriti issues, and, in many ways, we do not believe that that bill has got there. There are too many voices not heard in that bill. We acknowledge that Te Atiawa, whom we have been seeking advice from on this, were prepared to allow it go ahead, but they acknowledged that there were flaws, and there are. Waitara is symbolic, in a way, of the deeply flawed nature of trying to fix a mess created by my culture, and benefited from—still benefiting, still doing well. Great! Fantastic! But that perpetual lease issue with the Pekapeka Block is a deep stain, and I would love to see a healing through that process that was actually about the generosity of my culture, and not just the generosity of tangata whenua. I would love to see Pākehā katoa support Taranaki Pākehā to stand up and say that these resources need to go directly back to the people. We need to find a way, and that local bill does not do that.</p><p class="a">However, this bill that we are here to talk about has many good aspects to it, and it shows that incredible work has been done. But I do want to touch on an issue raised by my colleague Marama Fox about the first right of refusal, or right of first refusal—the more I learn about it, the more fascinated I get. In reference to the leasehold land in Taranaki, it was offered to Te Atiawa for $23 million. I always find it curious if someone has something stolen and then they have to buy it back: $23 million is an interesting response to a thieving—which may be a rude word, but I think we need to speak truth to power every day about what has happened in this country. Especially in the context—and here I want to mihi to Dr Leonie Pīhama—of the Karori campus debacle, whereby the Crown, in 2014, gave the university the right to the whenua that was Te Atiawa's for 10 bucks—in 2014. How does that work? And then they can sell it for millions of bucks. So there is good work going on here in this bill, but still the iwi have this offer that they cannot afford—23 million bucks—because when you have been robbed you often do not have a lot. And then there is the Karori campus—ten bucks and a few blankets. It is—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Marama </strong><strong>Fox</strong>: Criminal.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CATHERINE DELAHUNTY</strong>: Well, it is contradictory to the stated aspirations of this House that these things are happening in the 21st century. It is a bit like my bill last night, the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Maōri Land) Amendment Bill, that was voted down by the Government—no more Māori land confiscation. People were saying it is historic; I am interested in history and the way that history is in the present, and I am interested in the fact that this bill shows deep generosity, deep commitment to dialogue, and deep kindness.</p><p class="a">I would like to acknowledge that when we walked from New Plymouth—and I only walked the last day of the peace walk to Parihaka with Mayor Andrew Judd—every step was an opportunity to learn about the iwi katoa of the area: of Te Atiawa, who participated in the support of Parihaka, and the suffering that they paid for it. There are people who disappeared and we still do not know what happened to them because they were taken south and never seen again. Just finally, I need to say that that story needs to be taught to every single child in this country, not as an interesting historical artefact but as a passionate call for justice and a recognition of what tangata whenua truly offer this country, which is peace leadership, which is justice leadership, and that the past is in front of us.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p></div></body>

I would like to acknowledge the iwi leaders we have here from Taranaki, and it is great to have you here today. I am disappointed that it is only one day and not two, and I do acknowledge the Minister's comments that he is going to work very, very hard to ensure that the third readings are done as soon as possible, because not only is that going to be very important to bring an end to this process but it is going to be very important to be part of the beginning of what the future is going to be. </p><p class="a">I would like to, at this point, also acknowledge those who cannot be here, and I think especially of Wikitōria Keenan and the tremendous hard work that she has done on behalf of her people, Te Atiawa, in progressing this. I would also like to acknowledge the Hon Mahara Okeroa—great to see you, sir. I have very much enjoyed getting to know you over the last number of years, and I know that you have brought a great contribution. </p><p class="a">What I would like to say is, really, to support the people of Te Atiawa, Taranaki, and Ngāruahine, because these are some of the finest people I know. It is not just because of 176 years of duress since the pressures came upon them by the Crown to, essentially, forgo their land and they fought and struggled to retain that which was theirs. But there has been an aspect of generosity and inclusion. I think of the words of Wīremu Kīngi, who said: "You have your part, we have our part, and love will bring us together." Even back in his time, when he led and he spoke, there was this willingness to live together and work together. More than anything else, I hope and trust and pray that these settlements will engender that, and that we will see a future for Te Atiawa that is full of promise, full of hope, full of the ability now—through the resources of this settlement—for you to become who you always have been but in greater measure, and that is a proud and a noble and a generous people. </p><p class="a">I am very pleased to stand here. I apologise that I was not here for the first reading. I was overseas at the time and, as you know, matters in terms of the programme of Parliament can change very quickly and sometimes we hear a little bit too late that something is happening. I was in the UK at that particular point in time, but I do know that it was a great occasion. </p><p class="a">I am not going to say much more except to say I am thrilled about today. I am thrilled about today, that we are progressing this and, as I said, my great hope and joy will be to see the people of Te Atiawa, Taranaki, and Ngāruahine continue to grow, to develop, and to flourish because of this. This is nothing compared with what you have lost, I know. In fact, somebody said to me: "How much is this going to cost us?". I said it is costing nothing compared with what it has cost our iwi. We understand what it has cost you, and our hope and prayer is that this will become the beginning of something new. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

It seems, given the tenor of discussions today, that my party may be the only party that wishes to see this bill go through to its third reading immediately. I just want to say in front of the people who are gathered here today that we appear to be the only party that is prepared to see the third reading of this bill today. We will even give some leeway to the rest of the parties, particularly the Opposition, in that we will wait until tomorrow morning so that they can gather their troops. I want to make the point, as alluded to by a previous speaker, that we did not pull the bill; they did. The person who made that comment often talks about the value of sitting at the table. Well, they sit at the table, so why did they not take the initiative to say to Government: "No, we want to proceed."?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Marama </strong><strong>Fox</strong>: We did.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>PITA PARAONE</strong>: Well, then, what happened?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon </strong><strong>Member</strong>: You pulled out.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>PITA PARAONE</strong>: No, no—anyway, getting back to the bill.</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</strong>: You have got a whole basketful of dirty laundry. Let us keep it to ourselves.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>PITA PARAONE</strong>: Well, I am not too keen about the comment about dirty laundry, because we are pretty clean on this side. However, I want to say, for New Zealand First, that we support this bill. In fact, we support this bill, in particular, because of the tragedy that these people have had to suffer by the colonial forces of the time. I can recall—and it will be always an enduring matter for me—when I saw two young gentlemen representing their iwi of Ngāti Mutunga and doing their settlement process. I was appalled at the level of quantum that was offered to them. I asked those representatives why they were accepting that amount, given the history of that area. However, as alluded to by a number of speakers before me, they recognised, and we certainly do recognise, that any settlement will never ever be a complete compensation—or whatever you might want to call it—given the losses that they have suffered. And yet iwi—and not only the Taranaki iwi but all those who have already settled—have made a contribution to this country that many of our fellow citizens do not understand or even recognise. I want to acknowledge the contribution that Te Atiawa is making under this claims settlement bill. </p><p class="a">I do not need to make reference to, or reiterate, the history. It is well known. It certainly is well known by those who are associated with Treaty claims. But it is not well known by the wider community. We saw a leading local body politician who finally understood what the iwi were on about—he was vilified for the stance he took. I think that is a poor commentary on the state of our country. I can recall an earlier discussion regarding a petition made by two young schoolgirls from Waikato, from Tainui. They were asking about the history of our country being taught in schools. The reaction to this particular settlement bill by the wider community is every reason why we should be teaching New Zealand history in our schools. The travesty of the time and the effects of the colonial forces on innocent Māori should not be a reason for not allowing future generations to learn about their history. </p><p class="a">So although we have one or two concerns about the bill, we will certainly be supporting it to see it settled. I want to reiterate the point again, as the people in the gallery are my witness, that we want to settle and we are prepared to do that tomorrow morning. We will even do it today if we are allowed to, but we will certainly be here to do it tomorrow morning if there is a will on the part of the Government.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 09:57:50" ></a><strong>LOUISA WALL (Labour—Manurewa)</strong>: </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">Today is a really special day. It is a special day because this is Te Atiawa's day. It is the day when we as parliamentarians support the iwi in its process of resolving historical Treaty of Waitangi issues. It is when we as parliamentarians tautoko the process. So it is a bit of a sad day when we are not 100 percent focused on the whānau who have travelled so far today because of a Taranaki claim that went to the Waitangi Tribunal initiated by the Taranaki Māori Trust Board in 1987.</p><p class="a">So we are here because of the mahi that the tūpuna of Te Atiawa undertook when we opened up the opportunity to investigate Treaty of Waitangi breaches right back to 1840. What happened after the Taranaki Māori Trust Board in 1987 took the first case was that the Waitangi Tribunal released a report on 11 June 1996. That report was called <em>The Taranaki Report—Kaupapa </em><em>T</em><em>uat</em><em>ahi</em>. It took another 14 years for the process to be started again, and so in 2010 the Crown recommended negotiations with Te Atiawa.</p><p class="a">The second reading of a bill is about the principles of the bill, and it is also to provide some korero from the submissions. So for us to do that, I just want to focus on what this process is all about. This is about the Treaty of Waitangi Act of 1975, and in the "Purpose" section of that Act it says they wanted to create a tribunal to make "recommendations on claims relating to the practical application of the Treaty and to determine whether certain matters are inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty [of Waitangi]". The amendment Act of 1985 then enabled us to go back to 1840.</p><p class="a">So the bill before the House today, the Te Atiawa Claims Settlement Bill, gives effect to the deed of settlement agreed by the Crown and Te Atiawa that was signed on 9 August 2014. I would like to read from the submission of Liana Poutū: "The settlement of these claims has taken generations to reach this point and we are grateful to our many tūpuna, who worked tirelessly on this kaupapa so that their mokopuna would not have to carry the burden that they carried for so long. I am well aware that this settlement does not even come close to compensating our people for the losses and sacrifices we have endured, but we are still here and intend on being around to see that the work of those before us is not wasted." So, on behalf of Te Kotahitanga o Te Atiawa Trust, she says it supports the bill in its entirety.</p><p class="a">I think it is really important that we focus on what is in the bill, and I want to take the opportunity to read some sections from <em>The Taranaki Report</em>: "3.6 Waitara". The context is really interesting because, obviously, when Thomas Browne, who became our Governor, replaced Governor Grey in 1855, he was sent here for a very specific purpose, and that was to secure lands. It says in that report that his resolve to secure the Taranaki lands for settlement was an imperative—an imperative of his appointment. So in 1856 he appointed a board to inquire and to report on the status of Taranaki lands, and I just want to quote from that report about the board's view. It was: "the 'tribe' "—Taranaki—"that had the only authority to dispose of land, and while the individual had certain possessory rights, 'there is no such thing as an individual claim, clear and independent of the tribal right' ". So it was really clear that any lands that were to be sold had to be agreed to by the tribe and that individuals could not sell land.</p><p class="a">Governor Browne then visited Taranaki on 8 March 1859 and he announced a policy, and I would like to read that policy to the House today. First: "any person committing violence or outrage within 'European boundaries' would be dealt with under the criminal law;", but, secondly, he said he "would not buy land with a disputed title and 'would buy no man's land without his consent' ", and herein, I guess, lie the issues around Pekapeka.</p><p class="a">I found it interesting when I went on to the New Zealand in History website, because there is a section called "The New Zealand Wars" and a Taranaki War time line. It starts in 1859, and it says: "Te Atiawa tribe offers to sell land at Waitara. Surveying commences in 1860, but is interrupted by Wiremu Kingi Te Rangitake, a Te Atiawa chief who objects to the land sale." So I found it really interesting that it said that the tribe offered to sell it, but, actually, its rangatira objected to the sale. Obviously, the issue was not about the tribe selling it; it was about land agents at that time finding someone—an individual—who was willing to sell the land.</p><p class="a">I want to quote again from the tribunal report. The person who wanted to sell it—his name was Te Teira. Kingi was aware that he had asked for payment and that he had entered into this negotiation with Governor Browne, and this is what he wrote to the Governor: "I will not agree to our bedroom being sold (I mean Waitara here), for this bed belongs to all of us; and do not you be in haste to give the money. If you give the money secretly, you will get no land for it. You may insist, but I will never agree to it … All I have to say to you, O Governor, is that none of this land will be given to you, never, never, till I die. I have heard it is said that I am to be imprisoned because of this land. I am very sad because of this word. Why is it? You should remember that the Maoris and Pakehas are living quietly upon their pieces of land, and therefore do not you disturb them."</p><p class="a">In preparing for my kōrero today, I found a press release dated 10 October 2000. It was by the Hon Parekura Horomia, and it was to mark the 25th anniversary of the Waitangi Tribunal. He quoted from Judge Durie at the time, who, after 20 years of experience, had four things to say: "1. The room for ethnic misunderstanding. Therefore in its reporting the Tribunal has tried to explain Maori cultural views, as it appeared from the evidence, so that Maori and Pakeha might understand one another better in the future. 2. The need to report fully in order to put the past at rest. 3. The need to make practical recommendations so that something positive might happen in the future. 4. And that the process underlined for him how important it is that all people should have access to an appropriate judicial forum to express legitimate concerns."</p><p class="a">So I think what the process has endeavoured to do is to provide that forum, but for some people who are not aware of what is happening around them, they do not engage early enough, and, I think, if we look at what is going to happen in terms of the debate around Waitara and the proposition that the New Plymouth District Council has put to the House, I think it is really important that we focus on the right of first refusal for the whānau of Te Atiawa in Waitara. I just want to highlight article 2 of the Treaty of Waitangi, actually, where the Queen confirmed and guaranteed to Māori "the full exclusive and undisturbed possession of [our] Lands" for as long as we "wish and desire to retain" them in our possession. What we agreed, in being guaranteed our full and undisturbed possession, was that the Crown had an exclusive right of pre-emption over that land.</p><p class="a">I guess, if we want to look at Waitara and an opportunity for Te Atiawa to have the first right of refusal, actually, we should look no further than the Treaty in enabling that specific provision in the Waitara bill, because from the council position, it is saying: "We are going to give Te Atiawa a monopoly. They will have an exclusive right, an only right, to buy the land." Well, I guess my challenge to us is: what is wrong with that? Because that is what we said in the Treaty. Nō reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa.</p></div></body>

I would also like to acknowledge Maharoa Okeroa, our Minister Finlayson, and also I would like to acknowledge our committee chair, Nuk Korako, who has worked tirelessly not only on this legislation but on a number of pieces of legislation. </p><p class="a">I would also like to acknowledge the Te Atiawa iwi, those who have gone before us. I know the work that people such as Wikitōria Keenan put into preparing for this deed of settlement. I would also like to acknowledge the Te Atiawa generosity in accepting what has been offered in terms of this negotiation, because for everything that the iwi has been through over the last 156 years, or whatever it is, it has just been an awful situation, and it has taken a very long time to redress. </p><p class="a">By the mid-1850s Crown land purchasing had contributed to hostility and fighting within Te Atiawa, resulting in the loss of life for Te Atiawa people. In March 1860 the Crown's insistence on completing a land purchase at Waitara, despite the strong opposition of many Te Atiawa, led to the outbreak of the first Taranaki War. Fighting continued until a peace agreement in April 1861 that provided for the Waitara purchase to be investigated. However, the Crown precipitated another war by occupying various blocks before this investigation was completed. Although the Crown renounced the Waitara purchase it was too late to prevent the fighting, which continued into 1864. </p><p class="a">The Crown exacerbated the terrible impact of the wars on Taranaki by indiscriminately confiscating the entire rohe of Te Atiawa in 1865. In the 1870s and 1880s the Crown caused great distress to the iwi by the repressive measures it took to suppress the peaceful resistance campaign of Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi who established the settlement of Parihaka. In 1879 and 1880 many Te Atiawa were made political prisoners and detained without trial in the South Island. </p><p class="a">Although the lands confiscated made a significant contribution to the wealth and development of this country, in recent years many Te Atiawa people have lived in very poor economic circumstances. The resilience of these people is evident, and today this growing iwi has a vision of the future that moves from raupatu to restoration. </p><p class="a">I would like to acknowledge the iwi today. I would like to acknowledge the vision that you have for your people of Taranaki. I would like to help you, and offer to be part of anything that you would like to do going forward. We have a lot of making up to do, and this settlement is only a very small part of that. So thank you very much for the opportunity. Kia ora.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Bill read a second time.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone"><em>Waiata</em></p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="BillDebate"><strong>TARANAKI IWI CLAIMS SETTLEMENT BILL</strong></p><p class="SubDebate"><strong>Second Reading</strong></p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 10:22:48" ></a><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON (Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations)</strong>: I move, <em>That the Taranaki Iwi Claims Settlement Bill be now read a second time</em>. This bill gives effect to the deed of settlement between the Crown and Taranaki iwi, which was signed in a very emotional ceremony at Pukeiti gardens in September 2015. It provides financial, commercial, and cultural redress, and acknowledges the losses suffered by Taranaki iwi arising from very serious breaches by the Crown of its Treaty obligations. </p><p class="a">Can I acknowledge the work of the Taranaki iwi negotiators, as I stare at Mahara Okeroa. Can I acknowledge my ministerial colleagues, local government, and other agencies that have contributed to this bill.</p><p class="a">I also want to thank the chair and members of the Māori Affairs Committee for their very good work during the consideration of the bill and the exploration of the issues raised in submissions. The bill was referred to the committee on 25 March. Seven submissions were received from interested groups and individuals, and the committee heard from four submitters at hearings in New Plymouth on 2 June 2016. The committee reported the bill back to the House just a couple of weeks ago and recommended it be passed with a number of minor technical amendments. These include amendments to clarify the vesting of cultural redress sites, to clarify the right of first refusal provisions, and to update the legal descriptions of redress sites.</p><p class="a">Can I say, it is a testament to the hard work of the negotiators that the Taranaki Regional Council fully supports representation of the iwi of Taranaki on the two council standing committees. Taranaki iwi also have the support of their neighbours for the progress of the bill and for joint redress, including the vesting of Ngā Motu with Te Atiawa. The matter of iwi representation on the Taranaki Regional Council standing committees also arose last week at the Committee stage of the Ngāruahine Claims Settlement Bill. I mention it because it is relevant to both this and the other Taranaki settlement bill going through the House today, which contain the same provisions in relation to these committees. </p><p class="a">At the Committee stage of the Ngāruahine debate, New Zealand First proposed a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to remove iwi representation on these two standing committees of the Taranaki Regional Council. I then explained to the Committee why it was appropriate to have iwi representation on these committees, just as, for example, some other members of the current committees are appointed from external bodies, including from Federated Farmers, who are, in effect, an unelected member. After my explanation, New Zealand First withdrew its SOP, and as far as I can tell—and I acknowledge that I am not a psychic—this could be one of the reasons New Zealand First has raised an eleventh-hour objection to this bill. It is simply unclear, but I very much look forward to hearing the explanation, because I think it is about representation. But I do say to those members, the clauses in the Taranaki Iwi Claims Settlement Bill dealing with this issue are exactly the same as in the Te Atiawa Claims Settlement Bill, which, of course, they voted through a few minutes ago. So it is all confusing, and I very much look forward to hearing what I am sure will be a splendid explanation from Pita Paraone, or Mr Peters—well, from Mr Paraone.</p><p class="a"><em>The Taranaki Report: Kaupapa </em><em>Tuatahi</em> was the Waitangi Tribunal report about which mention has been made already this morning. It was released in 1996. It is well worth a read, including by people who write to me, as someone has this morning—I will not mention his name, because I do not want to embarrass him. He could be a New Zealand First branch chair. He wrote "I read with real disgust your further attempts to impose Māori on the rest of the population without the population's consent.", and then he commented along those lines—a very helpful contribution to the debate! But I do think it would be useful for people to look at the events underlying the Taranaki iwi claims, because they are some of the most severe in this country. I very much look forward to people like my correspondent learning more about Treaty settlements and, in particular, the history of Taranaki iwi and what they have suffered, and the history of what happened at Parihaka—and it was not all that long ago. I look forward to the continued benefit of Treaty settlements for our regional economies and Māori communities. These settlements, once they receive the Royal assent, will bring over $200 million into the great Taranaki province.</p><p class="a">Throughout negotiations Taranaki iwi have signalled the importance of addressing the issue of Parihaka. The Crown's actions at Parihaka were some of the worst examples of colonial repression in New Zealand, and judging from the contributions made by various members around the Chamber this morning, I think people know that pretty well around here. The Crown has to address the harm its actions caused the residents of Parihaka, both past and present. The Crown is working to restore its relationship with Parihaka, to re-establish trust with the community, and I think both sides are working very carefully and are not rushing things because this is a very, very important issue. As a first step in May this year, I signed a compact of trust with Parihaka. We are now on the road to reconciliation with the community, and it is a journey that is long overdue. </p><p class="a">Ngāti Maru has now signed terms of negotiations and is ready to negotiate. That is the last iwi of Taranaki that will be involved in negotiations, and that now means that the Crown and all the iwi of Taranaki can look to the issue of the maunga. All iwi have connections to Taranaki maunga, and I look forward to beginning those negotiations in the near future with all the iwi of Taranaki, to recognise the importance of the maunga.</p><p class="a">This second reading brings us closer to the concluding stages of the settlement process for Taranaki iwi, and seeks to recognise what is important to the people of the iwi and to provide redress for the historical breaches. I very much look forward to hosting the iwi of Taranaki here in Wellington for a joint third reading of the Taranaki iwi, Te Atiawa, and Ngāruahine claims settlement bills in the very, very near future. I commend this bill to the House.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 10:30:30" ></a><strong>KELVIN DAVIS (Labour—Te Tai Tokerau)</strong>: Tēnā koe, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">First of all, I would just like to say that I am disappointed by the exchange that I have seen this morning between members across the House. Yesterday in our Māori Affairs Committee we asked officials to leave. The members remained and we had a discussion around this when we expressed our views, led admirably by the Hon Nanaia Mahuta. We said we would have our say in that select committee, we would do it face to face, and we would leave it there. So it is really unfortunate to see that the confidence of the Māori Affairs Committee, a committee that generally works very well together, has been broken. It was disappointing to see those exchanges because, to me, it was posturing, when we had had our say yesterday and it should have been left in the room there. </p><p class="a">This second reading is a time to talk about the people and about the bill, and so we need to do that. Taranaki iwi, along with the other iwi around Taranaki maunga, were subjected to some of the most atrocious conditions by colonial forces back in the time. Some 1.2 million acres of land was confiscated from them. If we put that into the context of today, with our population of 4.8 million, 1.2 million acres would, in fact, provide a quarter-acre section for every New Zealander alive today. That is the extent of the confiscation of the land in that time. We need to reflect on just how great an impact that sort of confiscation would have on a people. </p><p class="a">I think it was the first reading when I said that if somebody came and invaded our country and confiscated land, we would go to war to defend ourselves, and, quite frankly, that is what—well, actually, it is not quite what Taranaki did. In the first instance, they resorted to peaceful resistance. People who resorted to peaceful resistance were then arrested in their hundreds—most of them detained without trial—and yet nothing happened to the invader. The invader was, in fact, rewarded for its acts of aggression, and, consequently, now possesses most of the land in Taranaki, leaving Taranaki iwi basically landless. So this bill contains acknowledgments of the Crown's actions that breached the Treaty of Waitangi, and it contains an apology for those breaches. </p><p class="a">The apology and the quantum that is being returned—and I heard from the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations that some $200 million will go into the Taranaki region. That $200 million is great, but if we put it into the context of 1.2 million acres being confiscated and the price of land these days, we will see that it is just a drop in a bucket. I have also said in this House previously that we need to—sorry, I will just go to that text that the Minister read out. It was somebody basically objecting to all of this, and focusing on "You're giving Māoris this and you're giving Māoris that." We should focus less on what Māori are getting and focus more on what has been lost. </p><p class="a">When we look at the size of the loss and the scale of the loss, the $200 million that may be coming back pales in significance. It represents the ongoing impact of all of those actions of the Crown in the 1860s that are having a lasting effect on Taranaki iwi, and it has been replicated right throughout the country over time, through all iwi. The ongoing effects that we are now seeing in terms of Māori incarceration, the lack of Māori achievement, educational achievement at school—just the loss of Māori potential. It is the genuine hope that that $200 million will go towards turning that around, so that Māori in Taranaki can fulfil their potential from here on in and become the leaders in the economy, the leaders in business, the leaders in education, and the leaders in the community. </p><p class="a">The bill provides a mechanism for iwi representation on the Taranaki Regional Council. That is admirable, despite the text that the Minister received and read out parts of. Minister, you should have a word to David Seymour about sending texts like that! The iwi are able to nominate three members for appointment to the committee of the council. </p><p class="a">I really fail to see what the country is scared of when we have Māori representation. Let us face it: Māori are environmentalists—you know, into conservation, into doing what is right for communities and for the environment. Really, Māori participation in council and decision making is only going to bring strengths to the Taranaki region. It is not something that Pākehā should ever be scared about. The fear is really something that is self-generated and self-perpetuating. </p><p class="a">The bill provides for changes to place names, and one of those place names is St George's Redoubt. I went online to check out exactly the history around St George's Redoubt. "St George" as a name for a Māori area to me is quite strange. I had to look up who the heck St George was, and apparently he was a Greek in the Roman army who was martyred because he would not give up his Christian faith. That is honourable, but what does a Greek Roman soldier have to do with Taranaki? The name is going to be changed to Tataraimaka. The history around St George's Redoubt—basically, there was some armed opposition to British forces. There was a battle. There was retaliation by Sir George Grey, when some 29 locals from Taranaki were killed, and the remains of 28 of them were transported and buried in an unmarked grave. It was unmarked, except for a concrete slab, for some time. They were buried in this area. </p><p class="a">It is important we realise that when we are talking about Treaty settlements we are actually talking about lives, about people who lived and existed and died for their cause. Those people died in a battle, and many more died in a battle of different sorts—just the battle to survive over the years. That is why it is really important that we do settle these claims. That is why I look forward to the swift passage of this bill through the House through all its stages.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p></div></body>

Every now and then I had one of my favourite students go: "Whaea Marama, ooh-sa—just chill." I am going to take that on board at the moment, but I will be very interested to hear what the objections are in regard to this bill. </p><p class="a">I want to echo the words of Te Whiti again: forbearance, patience, and stout-heartedness—that of the Taranaki people. I acknowledge Jamie Tuuta, Matua Mahara Okeroa, Toka Walden, Wayne Mulligan, Te Miringa Hohaia, who passed in 2011, and Peter Charleton, who passed earlier this year. Their efforts have brought us to this point, in hard-fought, hard-won negotiations. As long as we are here, we will have your back. As long as we continue to stand up and speak we will voice your concerns, as all of us in the House endeavour to do. I acknowledge all of the members of the Māori Affairs Committee and all of the members who have taken the time to consider the issues that have been brought before us.</p><p class="a">You know, they are right. This is not the embarrassment of one group, that we do not see it all the way to the end. It is the embarrassment of the whole House. I take that on board. Our people have been mucked around by the Crown. That is why we are here. That is why the grievance exists. And we have been mucked around again. We all need to accept that that is our issue to bear. So I apologise, on behalf of the House, that we could not see this all the way through tomorrow. In <em>The </em><em>Taranaki Report</em>, released in 1996, the Waitangi Tribunal said: "If war is the absence of peace, the war has never ended in Taranaki, because that essential prerequisite for peace among peoples, that each should be able to live with dignity on their own lands, is still absent and the protest over land rights continues to be made."</p><p class="a">The Crown breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi in Taranaki included warfare and they involved loss of life, the scorched earth tactics, imprisonment, raupatu, disempowerment, and the Crown's unprecedented actions at Parihaka. Given that just the other day was the day that we remember the suffragette movement—and if you see the flowers around the House, that is the acknowledgment of women's right to vote—I want to take this whakataukī, this proverb, this expression straight from Parihaka</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">That reference was made, and it encouraged the women of Parihaka to stand and speak, because all of the men had been taken away to prison, without trial, under the 1880 Maori Prisoners Act. And another is</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">This verse is from the waiata that refers to the bugle call at the army camp at Pungarehu. It signals the final stage in the process of loss for the people. You can almost feel and hear that bugle call now, as we sit in this House. We are at the final stage. We are at the last hour. We are at the moment when, finally, we can have the opportunity to take back and move ahead. Although that happens in law, we fully recognise that in Taranaki you have never stopped that fight. The whānau who are here have never stopped that fight.</p><p class="a">I want to acknowledge those members in the House who represent that area, and the efforts that you yourself have taken, Mr Deputy Speaker, and they have taken to bring yourselves to the knowledge of what happened in Taranaki, at Parihaka. It is not taught. It is not known widely. You can go and visit towns anywhere in the region and talk to the local people. They know nothing about what happened there. So I want to acknowledge the efforts that you and your colleagues have made to engage yourselves with the information, to educate yourselves in this process, and to support the voice and the call of the people—because it is their bill. Parihaka has become a symbol not just of peace but of the future, with the Kawe Tutaki, which is being headed and chaired by the Hon Dame Tariana Turia, and all of those others who are involved there. The excitement, the possibility of maybe a Parihaka Day, a Land Wars Day, and all of these things—you can hear the bugle call coming to this point. So I honour their resilience, the strength, the determination to hold on to the rope. I recognise that this settlement is an opportunity to restore the dignity and the mana, and create a true semblance of peace.</p><p class="a">The Māori Affairs Committee has examined the bill and unanimously recommends minor and technical amendments. The bill was sponsored by the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, the Hon Chris Finlayson. He has led the process for the Crown and has done an exemplary job. We want to mihi to him. But I want to mihi to the people of Taranaki for their fight, their commitment, their determination, and their forbearance, as in the kōrero of their tūpuna. I am honoured, I am humbled to be here, as part of the Māori Affairs Committee and the Māori Party, to say that we support you.</p><p class="a">Finally, in my first speech in this House I talked about the place where they passed those laws—the Maori Prisoners Act, the Tohunga Suppression Act, the Native Schools Act, the Suppression of Rebellion Act. When I first came to this House I went to look for that place where they stood and debated them. I wanted to see the seats they sat in, the House they stood in, and how dare they. How dare they talk about exterminating the natives—how dare they—and I could not find it because it had been burnt down. "Good job."—that is what I thought. But the record of the speech, of the kōrero, remains because it is the record of the words that are uttered in this House. So we read into the <em>Hansard</em>, as the Minister did, the raupatu—the confiscation—the grievances, and the issues, so that they would never be lost. Though the House burns down, the words remain. And so the words of Ngāti Te Whiti, of Tohu Kākahi, and of all our tūpuna remain.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p></div></body>

I would like to also acknowledge the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, the Māori Affairs Committee, and also the Pākehā MPs, like myself, who are from Taranaki—I am from Hauraki, actually—and the leadership we need to take. It is time for Pākehā to take leadership on educating our own about the importance of the history of Taranaki. I know that that is what we are committed to doing as MPs and that we have been fortunate to be on a journey that many of our fellow citizens have not been educated on or felt willing to embrace. That is up to us. We need to do this. We need to do this after this. We need this settlement to not just be between the Crown and Taranaki iwi; we need to bring our Pākehā people on board. So let us do it.</p><p class="ClauseAlone">Puketoretore (the water soaked peak) has emerged</p><p class="ClauseAlone">my taiaha expresses satisfaction</p><p class="ClauseAlone">I tread the land there below</p><p class="ClauseAlone">bearing my taiaha like</p><p class="ClauseAlone">the kakau toki (ceremonial adze)</p><p class="a">When we walked to Parihaka with Andrew Judd, the maunga was covered in cloud, and then I experienced the moment that is expressed in these words—when the maunga peak emerged through the clouds briefly. There was a rainbow and there was a moment when we could see the maunga. We could see Taranaki in all its glory. We tread that road with satisfaction because, at last, Pākehā were walking. I would just like to acknowledge that we walked to Parihaka that day, and some of the people who are in this gallery were with us because Taranaki iwi, in their generosity, walked alongside us. It is time that the hīkoi is the hīkoi of my culture in support of these settlements. It is time for that. It was a privilege to walk through the whenua of Taranaki iwi—the lush green whenua, the rich lands, the stolen lands—to Parihaka to hear the drum, to be welcomed. </p><p class="a">I would like to acknowledge in the House today the former MP Mahara Okeroa, who was present and who welcomed us, and all of Parihaka, who welcomed us in peace. In response to 1.2 million hectares being stolen, we have been offered peace. We need to take up that offer. I really need to acknowledge the importance of Parihaka. I am aware that the Minister is leading, as he does, another process for Parihaka in a creative way and that those processes will lead, hopefully, to an even greater national understanding of this place. Taranaki led the world in peaceful, non-violent resistance, as well as strategic warfare. I mihi to both those strategies, although I am in the Greens and we are non-violent. I mihi to both those strategies—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Nanaia </strong><strong>Mahuta</strong>: Ha, ha!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CATHERINE DELAHUNTY</strong>: —because I am Irish—no, because I cannot help it. Both the strategic military response to colonisation and the non-violent response through Parihaka are a credit to Taranaki iwi in terms of their survival. It is really important to recognise that the world talks about Gandhi, but before Gandhi there was Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi. We actually led the world—this country. How many kids get up in school and know that our peace leaders—the peace leaders of Taranaki—pre-dated non-violent resistance in India? They led the world. What happened next? We need to know, and we need to talk about what happened next. That is why we tread the road. </p><p class="a">I was proud to work with a mayor who actually understood this. I was at a seminar the other day with Andrew Judd and he said that before he was mayor, he had never been to a marae. He aha? How is it that we have leaders in this so-called successful democracy that we protect—"so-called" because we cannot have Māori representation, some people say—when we have a mayor who had never been to a marae? I bet he is not the only one. I hope he is the only one. He is not the only one now because he has taken steps to educate himself and to acknowledge, and he walked to Parihaka to do that. And we walked with him, and it was awesome because the people of Parihaka and of Taranaki iwi are here to teach us something about not only what it is to be in Aotearoa but what it is to be human. So I mihi to them, their tupuna, and to this bill as a chance for them to have a justice that will support the leadership they have already given this country. </p><p class="a">Talking about some aspects of that bill—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</strong>: That is good.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CATHERINE DELAHUNTY</strong>: —ha, ha, it is all about the bill, Mr Deputy Speaker, fear not—1.2 million acres was stolen, and $200 million is a good start, but, as everyone has said, it is a drop in a bucket. But we have to be real. You cannot live in this world now without cash, so at least it is a start. </p><p class="a">I want to speak more fully, though, on the issue of name change. Name change is an essential part of the Treaty settlements and an essential part of this Treaty settlement. We have to help our people—I am talking about my people—recognise and reimagine reality here, that they are on Māori land, that this is Aotearoa, and that these places had names. One of the most powerful techniques of colonisation is to wipe out the names of places and replace them with names that do not belong there. My ancestors come from the other side of the world, and we brought our names. Fine—we need to remember who we are, but we should not impose our names. We should not. So I support this settlement because it gives back and recognises the names that have always been there, have always lived there, underneath the veil of the colonisation process. So good on the settlement process for that—for the naming as it should be. We need a lot more of that. </p><p class="a">The other aspect of the settlement that I want to talk about is the Taranaki Regional Council—three members' representation on some committees. Guess what! The Pākehās do not vote for Māori in local government. Let us be honest. I know numerous people who have stood for local government—Māori who have stood—and have not been elected, year after year. Māori representation has not increased. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Clayton </strong><strong>Mitchell</strong>: That's ridiculous.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CATHERINE DELAHUNTY</strong>: It is ridiculous? It is true. It is sad but true that the population—we only need to look at the number of Māori on district councils and you will see that it has not increased, but the number of Māori who are standing continues to increase. So what is happening? Why would we not recognise the Treaty and actually recognise the contribution of the Treaty partner? Why is it that the Westminster model is the only way in which people can be represented? Article 2 of Te Tiriti o Waitangi recognises that the relationship of Te Tiriti is not about imposing the supposed democracy, and that is what—I do not even think this goes far enough, but at least it is a start. Again, it is a start, but it does not go far enough. </p><p class="a">The final things I want to talk about are—there are things that haunt me and should haunt us about this. We need to celebrate progress. We need to continue, and I acknowledge the Minister for the work around Parihaka. It is really exciting. </p><p class="a">We also need to remember that if we do not know the stories, we cannot move forward. As a person who has worked in Te Tiriti education, I want to acknowledge that I have spent many times sitting down with students, mainly Pākēha, and talking about the laws that affected Taranaki iwi—the Suppression of Rebellion Act, the Māori Prisoners Act. We need our young people to fully understand that this settlement is about those Acts. It is about trying to redress some of what was done, what was laid down then through the law, through this Parliament—this very Parliament did that. That is where it happened. The Governor ordered Captain Cracroft of the ship HMS<em> Niger</em> to bomb the Warea kāinga. Redoubts were established—that is a small sentence; it is a cold sentence. We need to realise that bombing took place. </p><p class="a">Now we need to do the healing. I honour Taranaki iwi, I honour Parihaka, and I honour the steps forward. Kia kaha. I am proud to have an opportunity to acknowledge you and to speak on this bill. Kia ora koutou katoa.</p></div></body>

It is good to see you and acknowledge Toka for your leadership within Taranaki iwi, and also, of course, Jamie, Hēmi, and Mahara—an awesome negotiation team who I believe have done a fantastic job for Taranaki iwi.</p><p class="a">Can I just say a few words: here in Taranaki we not just have the most profound history of the incredible hardship and duress and the shocking actions of the Crown against a people but we see this amazing response that leads the world—as the previous speaker, Catherine Delahunty, was saying—in terms of a peaceful resistance, which I believe is an international story. My hope, and I am sure it is yours as well, is that it becomes something that is increasingly recognised around the world as being something of tremendous forethought, thinking, depth of understanding, and nobility, and wanting to work through all the issues that all of that means. </p><p class="a">We think back to May 1879, when the followers of Te Whiti and Tohu began to plough across Taranaki as an assertion of their rights to the land. By the end of July, just a few months later, 182 ploughmen had been arrested. A number of years ago, I went to Dunedin to look at the place of incarceration because, as Catherine and others have said, we have, certainly from Taranaki, wanted to know the story. I was shocked and appalled to see that place of incarceration that they were taken to, many without trial—and what trial, anyway, would ever be considered to be righteous? It never was. So I think what we see here is an action and a series of actions against a people who sought to stand on their ground and who sought to oppose in a peaceful manner, and yet were treated so poorly throughout the years that followed. Even the Crown's compensation courts continued to perpetrate the confiscations in many, many regards. </p><p class="a">I want to say just a few more words, because I think that there is, right now, this turning point between looking at the past, understanding where we have come from—which is very, very important—and then, also, being able to step forward into our future. When we have the third reading of this bill—and then from that comes the greater release of the redresses and the settlements—there comes the opportunity to rebuild the economic base that once was. </p><p class="a">I look at the tremendous example of Ngāi Tahu, and my good friend and colleague Nuk Korako took us to Ngāi Tahu at the beginning of last year. We visited and met with them and learnt what they have done through their great skill and capacity, and how back in 1998, 18 years ago, they received a settlement of $170 million. They then built that asset base, as we know, to well over a billion dollars. They are the most prolific tourism operators, they have great holdings, and they have an amazing way of supporting their iwi, and I came away incredibly impressed at the industriousness and the great skill and strength that Ngāi Tahu bring not only to their people but also to the people of Canterbury and the South Island and to the whole country. </p><p class="a">I see and acknowledge what is able to be contributed to New Zealand through these settlements. First and foremost, it is for our iwi to have that economic base so that they can fulfil their aspirations, but we know that when you are strong, we are strong. When you succeed, we succeed. This is important because all of New Zealand should be celebrating these settlements, because it is coming to an opportunity where we can see that dark and difficult past dissolve into a brighter and a greater future. </p><p class="a">I want to say, as a member of the Taranaki community, that, particularly around Parihaka and the compact of trust, you can count on me to work with you to ensure your success. That place is going to be remembered and strengthened, and I believe it will be a place of great opportunity for the world to see what you have done in these difficult times. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 11:06:28" ></a><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS (Leader—NZ First)</strong>: Kia ora, tēnā koutou katoa. Can I just say to the people of Taranaki, who have heard all these statements out of this House these last 48 hours, to consider some of the facts. The Minister in charge of this bill, Chris Finlayson, says he came here to do good—his very words. No, he did not. He came here to make himself a Queen's Counsel by self-appointment on 13 December 2012. He used his office as Attorney-General to make himself a Queen's Counsel. He never got it from the profession, and surely he wants—after this, of course—to get a knighthood and be a judge as well, but he cannot win a seat.</p><p class="a">Can I ask you this question—ask anybody in Taranaki mindful of the west coast leases and what the National Government then offered to the people of Taranaki back in 1997: a lousy $28 million. One party stepped up, with its leader, and said "No, we'll pay the full price, $60 million.", and we did. That is our record, not National's. On the question of the Kermadecs—which is of interest to the people of Taranaki, as well—what happened in the Kermadecs? Well, the Government went down and sold out the total legal right, right under your nose, and the Māori Party was asleep. So before you hug your whānau from around the country, find out the Government's record. Mr Finlayson told my colleagues—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: This is outrageous, even by your standards—absolutely outrageous.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: —and I do not want to hear from that flyboy from Hamilton, who would not know a Māori if he fell over one. Just keep quiet—you, sir, know nothing about the Māori world. I am talking about bills that I have been aware of since I was a young lawyer in the early 1970s. I do not want to hear from a schoolteacher like you who knows nothing.</p><p class="a">Back to my point—back to my point. Mr Finlayson told my colleagues, he said: "Don't worry about this provision in the bill. It's identical to the Local Government Act." He said it is identical to the Local Government Act. At that point, my colleague pulled the Supplementary Order Paper on his assurance. Mr Finlayson, that was false, and I will prove it to you. That was demonstrably false, and the whip can get up and make any comment he likes, but the reality is that I will prove, on the documents today, that what he said was false.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Todd </strong><strong>Barclay</strong>: Sit down.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Here are the documents—oh, no, I am not sitting down. I will be here long after you have gone, sunshine. Ha, ha! I will be here long after you, because these Māori people up here are not going to be sucked in by your words of integrity and honesty and how you feel all the passion. Boy, I have been around in the Māori world a long time, and the last thing I am going to believe is you—make no bones about that.</p><p class="a">Do you know what the Local Government Act says—hear these words: "The members of a committee or subcommittee may, but need not be, elected members of the local authority, and a local authority or committee may …". If you go the bill that he said was identical—this "Blackstone of the Antipodes", this leading legal mind alongside Lord Denning from the Commonwealth. He told everybody on the Māori Affairs Committee that it was the same, but listen to these words: "The Council must appoint …"—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Todd </strong><strong>Barclay</strong>: Talk about the bill.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: This is the bill, sunshine. I am reading from the bill—dummy from Gore. I am reading from the bill. The man whose—half his electorate organisation walked off and joined New Zealand First, and you can see why. In the deep south they like the truth. They like honesty.</p><p class="a">Here we go: "The Council must …". Is "must" the word "may"? Are they the same? Mr Finlayson, are "must" and "may" the same? Well, do not go to the select committee and pull a whole lot of flannel and think that you are going to get away with it. You are found out, sunshine. </p><p class="a">He gets into a right little hissy fit. Did you hear him this morning? All the venom—"I came here to do good." Oh, really? What did he do about the Kermadecs? Go and ask the people of Ngāpuhi. What did he do about the Kermadecs? Ask Ngāi Tahu. You thought you could walk through there without the member finding out. Well, thank heavens they have got a party called New Zealand First. They have got a party called New Zealand First, and we keep the system honest.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: Speak about the bill.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: This is the bill, idiot features. Here we are, page 50—all right—clause 99(3). This is what is in the bill; I am reading it to you. That is how familiar he is, and that man is the whip. He is the organiser. You can see why National is falling in the polls, because that is the kind of "loony tunes", disorganised twit it has got organising the National caucus. But here we go—here is Gerry Brownlee—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: Absolutely outrageous behaviour—horrible, even by his standards.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Oh, lighten up, sunshine, I could eat you for breakfast. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: No, not for you.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Ha, ha! I could eat you for breakfast. Listen to him—loud-mouth.</p><p class="a">Here was Gerry Brownlee on <em>Morning Report</em>—he gets asked this: "How many National MPs were going to be there on Friday?". Do you know what he said? "Ah, look, I can't go into that because I am not the whip." He is the Leader of the House. There is Tim—that is the whip there. I know you find this incredulous. I know you find this unbelievable, that he could be a whip. But Gerry had not even consulted with him, and perhaps he had an excuse there. But he said: "I am not the whip, and don't have that info in front of me. But it would have been in the vicinity of, sort of, 40 people." Right, so if he has got 40 and we have got 12, what is the problem? Come on, let me ask you this question. If we have got 12 and they have got 40—according to Gerry—plus the Māori Party, plus the Greens, and plus Labour, then why are we not here tomorrow on this bill? Those members shut down your right. They shut down your entitlement. They pulled—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Order!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Gerry Brownlee pulled the vote. "Mr Whip", your bulbous, loud-mouthed behaviour does you no good at all. I have the transcript here of the Business Committee's workings and its diary, and it says that you are telling bulldust, so leave and go somewhere else—thank you very much. The House has got better all of a sudden. Ha, ha! </p><p class="a">Look, the interviewer is on to it. She said: "If there were 40-odd, wouldn't that—hang on a minute, Mr Brownlee. If there was 40-odd, wouldn't that give you the numbers?". This is from the <em>Morning Report</em> interview this morning—a direct transcript. Guess what Gerry said—he said: "I think you're missing the point here." What point would that be? Could the House sit tomorrow—yes or no? Today he says you are missing the point. But this is the point, though: "If you had 75 percent of the MPs here, which I think is about 44 members in National's case, then would you have had the numbers?". Listen to this one here—I know the people in Taranaki have heard too much bulldust over the years to fall for this sort of flimflam from them. Guess what Gerry said: "No, because"—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The</strong><strong> ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Order!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Oh, Mr Brownlee, sorry.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Peters.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: I apologise. The erstwhile Mr Brownlee: "No, because there is a formula for how you cast your vote." What formula would that be? The people of Taranaki are being taken for a ride right now. Pray tell me, the next speaker from National, what formula would that be? [<em>Interruption</em>] Do not laugh. Oh, they are looking down now, are they not? Ask the genius—the genius, the "Blackstone from the Antipodes", the man who thinks he is up there with Lord Denning. What formula, Mr Minister, would that be? Caught out—he has been caught out by his own words.</p><p class="a">Let me say this here: there is nothing to stop this legislation passing today and tomorrow. My party would be here to make sure it happens, as we said we would. I understand that every other party would have been as well, but National and the Māori Party briefly saw a chance to try to make some mileage. Well, it is not going to cut it—[<em>Interruption</em>] Do not shake your head. I know why you do that, because that is how you were born—with that stupid look.</p><p class="a">Can I just say, very clearly, that what matters is that in the dark of the night, the Government sneaked a provision into legislation that had been voted down dramatically in New Plymouth in May of last year, when 83 percent of people in the Taranaki area came out and said they did not want race-based appointments to the council. There were 83 percent who said that, but not this National Party. Having campaigned on "Kiwi not iwi"—which got it in here—it is now going back to an apartheid-type system where it wants, under this law, to appoint six people, paid for by ratepayers, on to the council, and none of them would be elected.</p><p class="a">This is the home of Sir Peter Buck. Sir Peter Buck, one of the greatest people ever, came to this Parliament. Māoridom still has that capacity in this Parliament, and what you are seeing today, I might tell you—whether you agree or not—is this: there is a party in this Parliament where Māori do not regard themselves as being pigeon-holed, being second-class citizens, or being tabulated by people like the Attorney-General. That party is called New Zealand First, and that is why we are making the stand we are making now.</p></div></body>

I acknowledge</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">I have said it often, and I am going to say it again on this bill: this is an expression of the generosity of an iwi to this country. When you accept a negotiated settlement that has a far lower value in commercial terms, then that is a gift to the country, and that needs to be acknowledged—despite everything around it, and in spite of all the issues that have been raised that are not really relevant to this bill within this, the lion's den, and I suppose that we have to acknowledge that that is what it is. I acknowledge all of the negotiators—both the Crown negotiators and the iwi negotiators as well—for bringing this issue to the House. I started off by recognising our poropititanga, and I join with other members who have acknowledged Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi for their visionary way of taking action in a way that never ever diminished their integrity, their mana, and the interests of the people. That is why I say to the House today this is an act of generosity. </p><p class="a">I support the bill because it is supported by all of the hapū of Taranaki iwi—that was very clear through the Māori Affairs Committee process. The changes that the Māori Affairs Committee has made are technical, and they make the bill a better one. I do want to address the issue of the Taranaki Regional Council. I think it is absolutely incorrect and wrong for anyone in this House to stand up and say that these clauses are race-based—they are not. These provide positions on a standing committee, not on the council itself. I think the issue that we also have to acknowledge is that Taranaki iwi, along with all the other iwi that have settled or are about to settle their claims, are a significant group within Taranaki, just like Federated Farmers are, and they have similar arrangements as well—without an Act of Parliament, without a deed of settlement. This is not about being Māori; this is about a large group of people within Taranaki who have—[<em>Interruption</em>]</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Trevor Mallard)</strong>: Order! I apologise to the member, but two of my friends and colleagues are having a conversation that is somehow getting into the sound system, and neither of them have quiet voices.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>ADRIAN RURAWHE</strong>: Thank you, e Te Māngai o Te Whare. As I was saying, this is a standing committee of the Taranaki Regional Council, not the council itself. It will play a very important role in the future of all of Taranaki, and a major voice of Taranaki iwi needs to be at that table. They need to have their voices heard in that context, and I mihi to the mana whenua. It is not all Māori who live in Taranaki. This is not about race; this is about iwi rights under Te Tiriti o Waitangi. I acknowledge my colleague Louisa Wall in her earlier contribution and Catherine Delahunty in her contribution, who highlighted those very facts. This is about upholding Te Tiriti o Waitangi. </p><p class="a">I spoke earlier about ensuring that all settlements are enduring. It would be a travesty for this Parliament to pass a piece of legislation based on a deed of settlement and then to try to back out of it. Parliament is better than that. It is wrong for Parliament to even attempt to do that. A deed of settlement between the Crown and the iwi is a binding contract—binding. We, as a Parliament, have an obligation to make sure that we work through all of those processes and that we try to make the bill a better bill—not to change the substantive issues within it, but to address technical issues and make changes where there is an agreement between the iwi and the Parliament. So I stand here to refute everything that was said by the Rt Hon Winston Peters on this issue.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">I want to speak about the major part for me, and for many, which is around cultural redress. The cultural redress mechanisms cannot be quantified in monetary terms, but it is huge, in this bill, within this settlement. There are well over 20 statutory acknowledgments and there are deeds of recognition. There are all the cultural redress mechanisms within this bill, which add and acknowledge the mana of Taranaki iwi. I want to acknowledge those negotiators who had the tenacity to bring together such a comprehensive cultural redress mechanism within this bill. Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou. Quite often, I think, those issues are lost within the context of the discussion in this House. </p><p class="a">I do not want to prolong this discussion. I think in the second reading we need to move this along and make sure that we get to third reading at the earliest possible time.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p></div></body>

Of all the Treaty settlements that have already been done to date, this one is actually the one that is probably the most meaningful for me, because this is the area where I grew up. I was born in Ōpunake and I lived a fair proportion of my early life near Ōrimupiko Marae. When I got married to my husband, Louis, we moved to a place called Ōaonui near Te Pōtaka. I went to school with many of the people who lived in and around Parihaka at that time—at Ōpunake High School. So, for me, this is actually very close to my heart and very close to home. </p><p class="a">I would just like to reiterate some of the words that have been said around Parihaka from the Hon Nanaia Mahuta in her speech that she has just made, about fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Parihaka. If you go into Puke Ariki museum in Ngā Motu you can actually see pictures of what Parihaka used to look like. To me, the devastation and everything that went on there—there are no words and no amount of money that can make up for that now. </p><p class="a">But, again, I want to comment on the generosity of the Taranaki iwi in accepting this settlement, and I also want to make mention of Adrian Rurawhe, who talked about the economy. I have actually got a copy of an article that he wrote for the <em>O</em><em>punake</em><em> </em><em>and Coastal </em><em>News</em> about the growing Māori economy and about the development phase and about the work that will happen for the young people. I really want to fully endorse that. </p><p class="a">I really want to wish Wharehoka Wano well as tumuwhakarito of Te Kāhui o Taranaki Trust, and the trust chairman, Toka Walden, who went to school with me. About the 5-year strategy, I know there are plans, I know there are visions, and I look forward to seeing not only the economic benefits that come from this Treaty settlement but, I think, more importantly for me, the cultural redress. I look forward to Parihaka being a wonderful place again for your people. </p><p class="a">So, for me, it is about any partnership between the Crown and the Taranaki iwi that can help to develop Parihaka, in particular, back to its status. It will never be what it was. It was taken away, and it is really sad that it was taken away in shame in such a peaceful protest, but we can develop Parihaka into something really fabulous again. So it is the economic redress, but, more importantly for me, it is the cultural redress. I commend this bill to the House.</p></div></body>

This bill gives effect to a deed of settlement between the Crown and the iwi, which was signed in December 2015, the closing stages of last year. It provides financial and cultural redress and acknowledges the losses suffered by Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa arising from serious breaches by the Crown of its Treaty obligations. I want to, as I do always, acknowledge the work of the negotiators for Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa, my ministerial colleagues, and the Government, and other agencies that have contributed to this bill.</p><p class="a">I also want to thank the chair and members of the Māori Affairs Committee for their hard work during the consideration of the bill and for the exploration of the issues that were raised in submissions. The bill was referred to the committee on 13 April this year, 19 submissions were received from interested groups and individuals, and the committee heard 11 of these at hearings in the Waitangi Treaty Grounds and in Wellington in June this year. The committee reported back to the House on 2 September, and it recommended that it be passed with some technical changes to land descriptions. </p><p class="a">There is one particular matter I want to refer to. In its commentary on the bill, the committee noted there were several submissions that asked for Stony Creek Station to be transferred to Ngāti Aukiwa rather than Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa, and they wanted it transferred as a distinct tribal entity. Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa, who are the mandated negotiators, have repeatedly advised the Crown that most marae and hapū have associations with the Stony Creek Station and the adjacent Thomson and Clarke Blocks. For a number of years, certain members of the Ngāti Aukiwa hapū within Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa have occupied the Stony Creek Station. </p><p class="a">There have been numerous attempts to repair the relationship between the iwi and the occupiers and have the occupiers leave Stony Creek. It is vital for the success of the Treaty settlement that the iwi can obtain its major Treaty settlement assets unencumbered and that they work together. The iwi is going to need to redevelop a farm that has been neglected and develop their assets for the benefit of all its beneficiaries. </p><p class="a">The station and adjacent blocks are going to be vested in the post-settlement governance entity (PSGE) on the proviso that the PSGE is responsible for finalising ownership. The trust deed of the PSGE requires the trust to develop a fair and transparent process, open to all members of Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa to review and determine the final ownership of Stony Creek Station no longer than 4 years after settlement date. If the process is not undertaken, any adult member of the iwi can apply to the High Court to have the conditions enforced. </p><p class="a">The second reading brings us one vital step closer to concluding all the work that has been done on this settlement over many years, including by Dr Michael Cullen. It is a process where the Crown, with iwi, has sought to identify what is important to the people of Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa and to reach agreement on redress for historical breaches of the Treaty. I commend the bill to the House.</p></div></body>

The bill is sponsored by the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, the Hon Chris Finlayson. As we have said this morning, they are getting pretty good at negotiating—they do not like giving away too much anymore. We used to try to get a few things in there, back in the day, and we have got better as negotiators for whānau, but the Crown has also got better. So we acknowledge the Minister—hard fought for, some of the settlements, hard fought. The bill gives effect to the deed of settlement that was entered into in December 2015, but the agreement in principle was signed in 2007. The mandate was signed in 2001.</p><p class="a">It has taken a long time to get to this point, and between 2007 and 2013 the negotiations that stalled were around the Stony Creek Station. We finally got to an outcome where it brings us forward, but it was an issue of contention in the Māori Affairs Committee and we debated it hotly to see whether we could find some other way to get it done. The settlement is made up of a package that includes a historical account, acknowledgments, an apology, cultural redress, and financial and commercial redress. The benefits of the settlement will be made available to all members of Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa. </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">The Crown apologises—and sometimes even the apology is hard to hear—and although it is appreciated, it does little to address the issues. But the people are resilient. We have seen it over and over again. We are still here, we are still fighting, and we will push on, apology or not, redress or not, but it does go some way to try to rectify the taumaha that we find ourselves sitting under, or that the whānau find themselves sitting under.</p><p class="a">So the cultural redress—let us just touch on that for a little minute. The cultural redress provides recognition of the traditional, historical, cultural, and spiritual associations of Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa with places and sites owned by the Crown within their primary area of interest. This allows Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa and the Crown to protect and enhance the conservation values associated with these sites. Sometimes even that is hard to bear—there is a cultural redress, but the Crown still owns it. But at least we are acknowledged in it, in some small way.</p><p class="a">The settlement provides for the vesting of 15 sites, though, back to Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa, subject to a few conditions. A statutory acknowledgment recognises an association between Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa and a particular site and enhances Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa's ability to participate in resource management processes—a step forward. The Crown offers statutory acknowledgments over four sites for which this can happen. The deed of recognition can be provided over sites where acknowledgments have been offered. So a deed of recognition says that Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa will be acknowledged in this place—thanks for that! It is hard, but thanks for that.</p><p class="a">There is something called an "overlay classification". It provides a very high degree of recognition and acknowledges Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa's spiritual, cultural, historical, and traditional values in respect of that site, and that has got to be a step forward. Actually there are wāhi tapu across the nation that, you know, are not acknowledged. We talked about some of our Land Wars sites. I was there at the koroneihana when they returned that whenua of Rangiriri, and the kuia said to me: "Marama, you know when it's Māori land: the road goes straight through it. When the road is straight, that was Māori land; when the road is curly, it's going around somebody's farm." So even though it is hard sometimes to understand the recognition of these wāhi tapu, at least now we have it. We can articulate it, and we can start to tell those stories of why these places are important. So those classifications—they use all these flash words, but I am just trying to explain what they mean to us, in significance. We can tell our stories.</p><p class="a">So the financial and commercial redress—you know, this is where it starts to bite a little bit. It is $6.2 million in lieu of the Crown's commitment in the 2007 agreement in principle to maintain the stock at Stony Creek. So $6.2 million—it just seems so insignificant today compared with the generations of loss. And although we appreciate it, we also acknowledge that it is the koha of the people back to the nation that we did not demand more. But to think that since 2001 and the mandate—and that is despite the years of bringing it to that point, with the research, and those members of the whānau who have passed away coming to this day—it has been 2001 the mandate, 2007 the deed, and all the way now to 2016. It has been a long time coming, which makes the fact that we cannot be celebrating its end tomorrow somewhat harder to accept. We have heard all the debate this morning—I will not go back into it, although I am tempted. But, whānau, I recognise that you are here and appreciate all of those who are not here, who have not made it through those 15 years since the signing of the agreement in principle, who have not made it to this point through the stalled negotiations, and who have not made it to this point since they started preparing the claim. I want to recognise them. </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p></div></body>

It is a small settlement in the scheme of settlements, but it has still been hard fought for by those who have been doing the work. Others have a great deal more knowledge than I do about the iwi and the hapū and the whānau connections in relation to this bill, but I do want to address the controversy that arose out of this legislation around Stony Creek Station. </p><p class="a">There has long been in settlement bills—especially in the early days; less so these days—real issues around the recognition of hapū and the Crown criteria for whom it will deal with. The Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations has talked about the mandate of iwi, and I acknowledge that that is the case with the process as it is, but that does not mean that that process delivers justice to all of those who have had their land taken or stolen by the Crown and who are entitled to justice through the settlement process. </p><p class="a">There are a number of settlements that are controversial within the iwi and hapū themselves. The issue for me, as a legislator, is how we make sure that the process that is used to deliver justice through these settlements does not in itself create further injustice and does not risk modern raupatu. That is a question that has been considered often in the debate in this House, but not often enough in the review of the settlement process, which does, at times, create an injustice that cannot be resolved. It is exacerbated by the legal process, but not resolved by the legal process. </p><p class="a">I think that that is, in effect, what is happening here. There is genuine controversy around Stony Creek Station. There was an occupation of that land over a long period of time by people who felt that they were having their land taken from them through the settlement. Whatever anyone may think of the individuals involved or the nature of that occupation, occupations by whānau, by hapū, and by iwi have been one of the only tools that they have had to demonstrate their connection to that land and their heartache at having that land taken from them. </p><p class="a">It is occupations, actually, that have led to justice being achieved in many of those cases. It was the occupation of Bastion Point that led to the resolution of Bastion Point. The history of occupation has to be taken seriously as a means by which people who have no other legal opportunity, who do not have the financial resources to buy lawyers, or who do not necessarily have access to members of Parliament who will advocate on their behalf—it is often the only tool that they have to assert their mana over the land that they believe was wrongly taken from them and should be returned. </p><p class="a">So I am concerned that the issue for Ngāti Aukiwa is not trivialised in this debate. It is a very real risk that, in the passing of this settlement bill, we are enacting a modern day raupatu. If we are going to pass this bill—and the Green Party members support Treaty settlement bills because we know how hard fought for they are and that there must be some restitution for the losses that iwi Māori suffer—we need to pass it knowing that. Knowing that means that there will be another day when we have another opportunity to remedy the wrong we may be committing today. </p><p class="a">So we cannot do this without acknowledging that it is going to come back at some point and somebody is going to have to deal with it—maybe us; maybe those who come after us. In acknowledging that and in recognising that Ngāti Aukiwa, in this case, and other iwi and hapū in other cases of settlement controversy, have the right to have their injustices and the thefts of their land acknowledged and treated seriously in this House. </p><p class="a">It is very important to us that we continue to review and reflect on the Treaty process itself to make sure that at every possible step it does not exacerbate harm, that it does not cause more raupatu, and that we are not continuing to cause harm to iwi Māori, to hapū, and to whānau. That is why we have always said that the full and final aspect of these settlements is what we write in the law, but we can never have a full and final settlement of the Treaty. The Treaty is an ongoing conversation. It is an ongoing issue, and it will be so for ever, because this is a colonised country. We cannot pretend that is not the case. </p><p class="a">These settlement bills are one tool that we are using in the process of delivering genuine Te Tiriti justice over time. It is a tool that has its failings. It has its advantages, but it is just one tool in the ongoing process of honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi. That is why the process for these settlements must be under constant review and reflection to make sure that it is not causing more harm. </p><p class="a">Unfortunately, I do not think that happens. We are actually on a journey with these settlements. There is a process that is under way. That process is rolled out, and there is not actually that much wiggle room. We know that iwi do not really get a chance to reassess, for example, the value of these settlements. We know that the mandating process is pretty much set in place. We know that the large natural groupings approach is pretty much set in place for the moment. </p><p class="a">Let us not forget that all of those criteria for how these settlements occur are not criteria established by Māori; they are criteria established by the Crown and are rolled out because of the precedent of having done it so many times. That does not make it just. It does not make it the right process; it just makes it the process we are using today. </p><p class="a">I want to genuinely acknowledge those who have worked very hard to get this settlement and to get some resolution for the loss of this iwi. I want to acknowledge all of those who have fought and lost their fight for justice for their losses as well today. Never let us trivialise the fact that sometimes we are causing harm in the process of trying to deliver justice to others. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 12:07:03" ></a><strong>NUK KORAKO (National)</strong>: Tēnā koe e Te Mana Whakawā.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">It is indeed my pleasure, as the chair of the Māori Affairs Committee, to speak on the Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa Claims Settlement Bill at the second reading. I want to be quite specific in what I am going to present here, because it is very much reflective of the work that the Māori Affairs Committee has done since the first reading, particularly going out to Waitangi to hear submissions from right across the whānau, hapū, and iwi of Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa, and also to get a very, very good insight into the feelings of Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa. </p><p class="a">As has been said in this House this morning, I must say that it has not been an easy journey, but there are a number of things, and the first one would be the question around participation in that ratification process of the Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa deed of settlement. We are advised that the level of participation was about 30.9 percent, and when we look at the total number of voting packs that were actually distributed, they accounted for about 2,426, but only 756 votes were received. This participation rate may seem in some ways disappointing, but we do understand that if you look at other Treaty settlements, this is considered a middle range of participation. That is the first point. Although we would all like overall participation to be higher and for more members of the iwi to have been involved, in this process our main concern is that members have had the opportunity, and we saw this. Members did have the opportunity to partake in this consensus, actually. That is the first point. </p><p class="a">The next one is that, to me, there was also a very open and transparent process to ratify the settlement, including widespread advertising of the hui, and voting packs that were widely distributed. That is that second point. But we can only hope, particularly when we look at this ratification process—it is a signal, though, that once this settlement debate is completed in the third reading, there is still a lot of work to be done to actually bring everyone together to work together, to hoe the waka together around that really important value of kotahitanga. </p><p class="a">The next part is that during the select committee process we heard about the disagreement over Mangawhero Marae and the settlement boundary. Looking at that, we were satisfied that the boundaries used in the settlement were appropriate and, given the support of most people in both Mangawhero Marae and Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa, that the marae is a Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa marae. That was really important, and that is something that we really did listen to, and we are very comfortable with that particular outcome. </p><p class="a">We also heard about the issues surrounding the ownership of Stony Creek Station—it has been mentioned here before. I just want to mention the fact that it had been demonstrated to us that the station had been illegally occupied by some members of Ngāti Aukiwa. That has been an ongoing thing since 2007. It was quite disappointing that these members, as a subgroup of Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa, had devalued the asset that forms the key feature of the redress in the iwi settlement. We heard that most Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa hapū and marae have associations with Stony Creek Station, and most members of Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa are also members of Ngāti Aukiwa. We have seen this before in Treaty settlements. The fact is that we did not want to play Solomon. We actually just wanted to get a very, very good overview of this issue. From the outside looking in, we were comfortable with the fact that there is that close association—bloodlines; whanauka—and so that is another part of the work that still needs to be done once this Treaty settlement has been finalised. </p><p class="a">The other part of this is that we were alerted to the concerns that the bill would extinguish other hapū claims and relationships with the Whakaangi mauka and the Whangaroa Harbour. The relationship of Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa to the Whakaangi Scenic Reserve is recognised through an overlay classification. However, this does not preclude other iwi or hapū from establishing a similar customary relationship on this site. So, again, it is actually acknowledging all of those who are involved and have relationships with the site. The other part of this is that we note that this settlement does not include any redress related to Whangaroa Harbour. </p><p class="a">There was also some discussion as to whether the Crown should make acknowledgments to individual hapū—and this was a really important one; particularly the acknowledgement to hapū. However, the Crown's approach—as we all know, working within the Treaty settlement process—is to settle with large natural groups, which, in this case, means that the acknowledgments and apologies are directed to Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa as an iwi, rather than to any particular hapū. That was our resolution and our understanding. The only amendments we have recommended to this bill, though, are very technical in nature and relate to changes to land descriptions. </p><p class="a">I look forward to taking this bill further after this second reading. I want to acknowledge those who have come from the Far North here to Pōneke today, and to also just acknowledge your manaaki to me, to our party, and to the Minister when we came to Ōtangaroa Marae in December to sign the deed of settlement. I was a witness to that. On that note, it has been a long journey. It will be a little longer—but we have been there—but it will suffice, and the third reading will come and you will have your settlement. As I have mentioned in my speech, this is only really the start of building that kotahitanga amongst your people and to taking that forward so that you are all hoe-ing that waka together.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">I commend this bill to the House. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 12:15:34" ></a><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS (Leader—NZ First)</strong>: Kia ora. Tēnā koutou katoa, and greetings to the people from Whangaroa who are back home there now, watching this parliamentary debate and hoping for some justice. </p><p class="a">Can I just say that it was curious for us to learn now that the Māori Party has members; indeed, the Green Party has members; and the National Party has members with the same reservations that New Zealand First has had for a long, long time. This matter was alive before the 1975 introduction of the Treaty of Waitangi legislation itself. That is a fact, and anyone who was a young lawyer back then would know that. So this is not new. But the point is that what we have got here is a whole lot of members of Parliament who are trying to say that a lot of people have relationships to certain blocks of land. That is not the issue; who has the principal relationship is the judgment that should be made now. </p><p class="a">Can I just say that the second reading and the third reading of this legislation should be taking place today and tomorrow, and if people want to know why it is not—can I just put on the record a statement by Tim Macindoe from 4 September. He wrote to the other members of the Business Committee and he asked: "I imagine you are all receiving a large number of requests from your colleagues"—this is dated 12 September—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: That's right—after the deal was done with your party and others.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: No, no—I will read it out. I will read it out. Do not shout out. Have a Valium.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: This member is betraying the iwi and betraying the House and betraying the whips. He is deplorable.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: No—exercise some control. I am going to read it out. You cannot stop me—you cannot stop me.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: No honour at all.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: I am reading it out. He said: "I imagine"—well, given his mind, he probably imagines a lot, yes? "I imagine you are all receiving a large number of requests"—[<em>Interruption</em>]—"from your colleagues for leave on Friday"—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: Order! I am sorry to interrupt the member. Interjections are fine, but using words that the member used is unacceptable and we will not have that.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. "I imagine you are all receiving a large number of requests from your colleagues for leave on Friday, 23 September, as I have been from mine." He asked whether or not there could be a reduction in the percentages and a vote on voices only. My colleague, the next day, sent a note that said: "Hi all, New Zealand First does not support this request for extra leave applications." It is all there. He is now caught out—caught out by his own words—and no amount of bombast and shouting from the uneducated teacher from Hamilton is going to override the facts of this document. He has been caught out. The reason why we are not having the third reading tomorrow is that he has given too much leave for his colleagues to be going on an early holiday. It is that simple. All they needed here tomorrow, for the people of Whangaroa, was 13 members—all they needed was 13 members.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: They have now betrayed their members and the House and the iwi.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Do not tell me—tell the people you are lying to. Tell the people you are lying to.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: Order! [<em>Interruption</em>] Order! I want this to calm down. The points have been made, and I ask you to just focus on what is in the bill.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. What I am saying to the whip and to the National Goverment is—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: This is outrageous.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Do not shout out here—tell them up there from Whangaroa, face to face, that your document is not true.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: I'm very happy to stand by my documents.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Oh, no—no, you are not very happy, because you are trying to shout me down. And you are a junior member and will probably be gone very shortly.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: I'm telling the truth about your actions.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Ha, ha! You—</p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: As I just mentioned previously, I want you to calm this down. The points have been well made about the concerns, and I just want you now to focus, in the remaining time, on what is in the bill.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Yes, Mr Assistant Speaker, but what is most important here is that we have got a bill, in its second reading, that could be having a third reading tomorrow except that a whole lot of members of Parliament, including the chair of the committee, have grave reservations, and so does New Zealand First, and I will tell you why.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Maggie </strong><strong>Barry</strong>: Stick to the issues.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Well, that member would not know a thing about Māoridom or, for that matter, about the Department of Conservation either, which is the reason why in the <em>Trans Tasman</em> <em>Political Alert</em> magazine she was described as a lightweight. Of course, she is going to get rid of, for $25,000, all pests in this country by 2050. If I was her, I would just keep my mouth shut. </p><p class="a">But here is the point: what members need to understand is that you cannot negotiate justice without the facts, and in respect of what is happening in Whangaroa, what is happening here is that there is no resolution—and it is in the bill itself. It says that this is not a resolution. A long time ago, people like, for example, Dr Cullen and Shane Jones and others were up there—a long time back, in fact, they were reported in the <em>Northern Advocate</em><em> </em>trying to negotiate a settlement up there, and there were the same problems back then as there are now. New Zealand First says that we will never settle it by passing this legislation and then saying: "Well, you can go to the court in the next 3 years, and if that is not resolved, then you come back here." That is not a resolution at all. Why do we not put the fire power in, put the investigative capacity in, find out the truth, and pass a bill once and for all so that everybody in Whangaroa can be happy? Who could disagree with that—instead of saying: "Let's go back to the court in 3 years' time." Who is going to pay for that? Who is going to pay for the court case?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: We've all agreed to. This is the member holding it up.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: I will tell you what is wrong with this Parliament. There is somebody there who has no understanding of any Māori issue at all. He does not understand that some of us were young lawyers up there, seeing Nuku Stewart and other people, in Whangaroa, a long time ago. Some of your forefathers—I remember them so well. He does not, but he is so arrogant that he shouts down someone who does know these people—unbelievably arrogant. Why does the member for Hamilton not just keep his mouth shut? </p><p class="a">As for "Madam Fox", let me tell you: why is the real leader of the Māori Party not speaking today?</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Marama </strong><strong>Fox</strong>: Back the people.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Why is the real leader of the Māori Party not speaking today? Why is the real leader of the Māori Party not speaking here today? That is a party, of course, that is going to oblivion. In fact, the Government pays so much attention to them—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: This member welched on the deal. That's the beginning and end of it—this member welched on the deal.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: I will tell the people of Whangaroa that if they witness what we are watching in the House today, it is every reason why they will know that they must not go with that group there. These two here: one is from Ngāti Porou; the other one is from the slum lands of England, and he is telling someone steeped in Māoridom in the north for hundreds of years to shut up in Parliament. How arrogant can you be? How arrogant can you be? </p><p class="a">Can I just say this: I have gone back and studied this for a long, long time. This bill is not a resolution—everybody who knows the north knows that.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Tim </strong><strong>Macindoe</strong>: It was when your party agreed to it. You have completely gone back on your word. </p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: Order!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. </p><p class="Intervention"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: I am dealing with the matter. [<em>Interruption</em>] I am on my feet and I will deal with this. I have asked members of the Government side to calm it down. Interjections are fine, but running commentaries and barracking are unacceptable. This is the third time—next time I will deal with this in a more direct manner. </p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Rt Hon WINSTON </strong><strong>PETERS</strong>: Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. Can I just say something? I have seen this sort of battering-ram legislation. I saw two iwi, in the case of the Tūhoe settlement, that were recognised by the most esteemed member of Parliament Māoridom has ever had here, by Ngata himself, just being ridden roughshod over. I am not going to see that happen up north—because that is what is happening here. </p><p class="a">I do not think that myself or Kelvin Davis or Peeni Henare have the final answer to this, but we know that one is capable of being found. My point is, to run roughshod in this Parliament and override these people, without so much as a by-your-leave, is compounding the very error that this bill claims to be correcting. That is what is wrong with this. That is what is wrong with this, and that is why we are not going to back off and be shouted down. I believe it can be resolved. </p><p class="a">For our part, New Zealand First will put the intellectual and professional firepower in to find the truth behind this matter. Because it is not possible—and we know, in our Māori world, this: what is the No. 1 principle of Polynesia or the Māori world? They who live on the land, who keep the land warm, they who are there should be the first voices on any matter. That is our rule—it has been for centuries. Why now have we got a group of parliamentarians, including some people who know nothing about this issue, telling us that they can correct it? </p><p class="a">In short, if we cannot fix up this area, area by area, and not go for the clobbering-machine solution, let us give it to iwi, have all the fights internal—and then the Government members will get up in Parliament and say: "But we gave you all the land. We gave you all the money. Now it's your problem. Now it's your problem." I can see them wiping their hands of it, and then they come in here with their fawned passion and concern. By gee, how I despise that. How many Māori out there are homeless? Tens of thousands of them. How many are in our prisons? Tens of thousands of them. Do those members have any priority about giving Māori a fair go in their own country? No, they bring in 70,000 foreigners every year to compete against Māori, and they stand up here and say they are concerned about Māoridom. No they are not. They are concerned about their own political longevity. </p><p class="a">And I am telling you—mark my words—we will campaign on this issue all the way to the next election. We find out up there in Whangaroa who knows what they are talking about. I want those members to turn up in Whangaroa and explain themselves, but, of course, if they did, they would be run out of town. They would be run out of town, as a former Minister was when he went up there. So I say: "Tread lightly. Listen to what the local people are saying." Why do we not come with a total resolution and not a half-pie settlement that, even in its own drafting, says that this matter will end up in the courts again. That is not legislation; that is foolery.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 12:26:40" ></a><strong>ADRIAN RURAWHE (Labour—Te Tai </strong><strong>Hauāuru</strong><strong>)</strong>: </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">It is a great pleasure to speak on this bill. Once again, I acknowledge my connection to Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa. I am a descendent of Kahukuraariki as well, and I want to acknowledge everyone else who has arrived here from the Far North for the second reading of this settlement bill. We have heard a lot of discussion today around the process of settlements, and, as one of the few in this House who has had the honour and pleasure of negotiating a settlement for my iwi of Ngāti Apa, I know—I said this in my first contribution and I will say it again today—that this process has its flaws. So I want to actually acknowledge some of the kōrero that the Rt Hon Winston Peters has said around the flaws of this process. But I also want to address how that can be addressed in the future. </p><p class="a">One of the key things around it is, of course, that settlement iwi—iwi that are in this process—have to ask themselves whether they can live with what this process can deliver and what it cannot deliver. That is an important part of the negotiating process. Quite clearly, we are in a position as a Parliament to acknowledge that they have gone through this process and have signed a deed of settlement, and now we are passing legislation that will enable that deed of settlement, which is a binding contract between the Crown and the iwi. </p><p class="a">I want to talk about how that will look in the future, because we want these settlements to be enduring—that they stand the test of time—which is one of the key parts of the settlement process. So what are the redress mechanisms actually based on? The process means, and we have all acknowledged it, that the Crown can provide redress but not compensation, so we have to accept that. We have to also look at the basis for each of those settlements, and there are some key things that we should be mindful of when the Crown uses the mechanisms that it uses for the settlement process. It looks at things like the amount of land loss, the nature of that loss, and relativity to previous claims. It looks at any special characteristics particular to that iwi or claimant group. These are the things that we should be mindful of when we are discussing these issues about how these settlements come into being, and that it is a negotiated situation between the claimant group and the Crown. </p><p class="a">As I have said, this process is not perfect, and it is incumbent upon every participant to ensure that they understand what is at stake. I believe that through the work of the Māori Affairs Committee—and I have read its report very carefully—all of those things have been considered. So I mihi to the Māori Affairs Committee. </p><p class="a">So where does that take us in the future? I believe that we will not be able to address the issue of relativity until every settlement has been completed, because we do not know the relativity of this settlement to a future settlement. We know the relativity—or we might think we do—of this settlement to all previous settlements, and we, at some stage, will need to ask the question about whether that issue around relativity has been addressed to our satisfaction. So I acknowledge the contribution of Metiria Turei in this discussion, because I think she raises those very issues around how this might fit into the future. </p><p class="a">This is a developing conversation, I believe, because if we look at previous debates on previous settlement bills, in the early stages when settlement legislation started, they could not possibly have predicted where we might be today—20 years later—and 20 years into the future. That is the discussion that we should have in a rational way so that we can preserve these settlements in an enduring way, but acknowledge that, at some stage, our future generations will have another look at it. That will be based around, I believe, the process of how we get to where we are today. </p><p class="a">I do not want to take up any more of the House's time. I think that today we should celebrate the really good things that are in these Treaty settlement bills, because they provide the opportunity for our people to enhance our aspirations moving forward for future generations.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 12:34:53" ></a><strong>KELVIN DAVIS (Labour—Te Tai Tokerau)</strong>: Tēnā koe, Mr Assistant Speaker.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">I just first apologise for being late to the House, because I did have a meeting in town, but I did catch the end of Peeni's speech where he said that our relations from Whangaroa brought down the kai moana and it is in his office, and we thank them for their koha. Also, we are offering up Peeni as the sacrificial lamb for the annual Piri Morgan inter-marae rugby competition that is played in Whangaroa every Labour weekend. Despite his advancing years, we are offering him. </p><p class="a">The people of Ngāti Kahu are my whanaunga. We are related through a number of ways, but one of our whakapapa lines—one of the many lines—is through Pōhurihanga of <em>Kurahaupō</em> waka. Pōhurihanga had Muriwhenua—most of the Far North was named after Muriwhenua, who had Tamatea, a well-known explorer in his time, not least of all because the longest Māori place name in New Zealand is a reference to him. He had Kahungunu, and we spoke about Kahungunu in the House last night. I acknowledge my tuahine here, Meka. Kahungunu had Kahukuranui, who had Kahukuraariki. I am not descended, as far as I am aware—unless my father has got some secrets that he has not let out—from Kahukuraariki but, instead, from the sibling of Kahukuraariki, Rākaihikuroa. So that just goes to show the complexity of our whakapapa and how we are all related. </p><p class="a">Pōhurihanga of <em>Kurahaupō</em>, though—and one of the reasons I brought this up is that we talk about these settlements being full and final and enduring. With the Kermadecs situation, maybe that is on pause. Maybe that is on hold; we are not quite sure. We cannot really stand here with our hands on our hearts and say that these settlements are now full and final and enduring if the situation around the Kermadecs is to continue. The reason I am trying to link it in is that Pōhurihanga's name, I believe, was just Pō, but when he came over on the <em>Kurahaupō</em> waka and it started to leak a bit, he had to turn around and go back to the Kermadecs, and turning around is like huri—Hurihanga. Pōhurihanga parked up the waka on the Kermadec Islands and fixed the waka up before he proceeded on again to New Zealand. I would say that probably happened a number of times with many waka, but it is just an illustration of our links to Rangitahuahua, the Kermadec Islands, but also the significance now that the Kermadec Islands are playing in all our settlements. </p><p class="a">There are real concerns that what was a settlement that was made around the fisheries in 1992 is no longer that permanent, enduring settlement. So we come to the Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa settlement. It will go through the House and all its stages and, no doubt, it will be passed. I hope that 25 years from now there is not another MP standing up and going: "Oh, sorry, Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa, the Government has changed its mind and the Act as it was passed in 2016 is going to be changed." I think it is a very important note to make that when we say that these bills are enduring and full and final, that is exactly what they are. </p><p class="a">The bill itself relates to Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa's historical claims, mainly to pre-Treaty land transactions and Crown purchasing. I spoke a bit about that last night, about the Crown's devious ways of purchasing land—the surplus lands policy. I spoke last night about how James Busby managed to get his hands on a hundred thousand acres around Ruakākā, which is not in Whangaroa. It was just an illustration of the way that land was taken off our people and they were left, basically, landless. The Crown failed to protect Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa reserves, and took land under the Public Works Act. Again, I acknowledge Catherine Delahunty for her bill, which, sadly, did not pass last night.</p><p class="a">There are about 3,000 people in the Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa tribe. I just want to talk about the ratification process the bill went through. There was concern about whether there was sufficient support. The level of the participation and the ratification was 30.9 percent of those who participated. The process lasted 7 weeks, and of 2,426 voting packs that went out to registered adult members, 750 votes were received. There is concern that that is low, but in the scheme of things, when you look at all the different statistics around all of the settlements that have gone through, the numbers and the percentages of people who voted and participated in the ratification process, this is actually a mid-range level of participation. I guess it is incumbent on people that if they receive a voting pack for their iwi issues, they actually need to engage in the process, and it is really at that stage that people can express one way or the other. There is no point in having a democratic process and then saying that the process did not get the result they wanted if they never actually voted. </p><p class="a">We have heard about the disagreements around whether Mangawhero Marae and Ōtangaroa should be included in the settlement boundary. We considered it, but did not consider that the boundary issue at Ōtangaroa was an obstacle to negotiations, because the Crown recognises general areas of interest rather than a precise boundary during the settlement process. </p><p class="a">Just in the short space of time I have left—we have touched on the ownership of Stony Creek. I do have a concern that the quantum, actually, is all tied up in Stony Creek. I would have liked to think that the people of Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa not only get Stony Creek Station back but also got a dollop of pūtea to go with it. Several submitters argued that Stony Creek should belong to Ngāti Aukiwa, as a distinct tribal entity from Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa. However, Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa said that most hapū and marae have associations with Stony Creek Station as well as the Thomson and Clarke lots in Taemārō Marae. </p><p class="a">I remember, basically, this bill was my introduction to politics. There was a day in December of 2007; it was the day after the end of the school year. I had resigned as the principal of Kaitāia Intermediate School, and Shane Jones said to me: "Hey, you want to get into Parliament? Come out and meet your constituents." So I went out to Taemaro Bay—a beautiful spot, as is the whole coastline around Whangaroa—and, not knowing what I was walking into, I should have known better than to wear jandals and a T-shirt; I should have worn my flak jacket. That was the day that Michael Cullen turned up in a helicopter and I found myself standing in between some angry Ngāti Kahu whanaunga and Michael Cullen. I was standing there, linking arms with Shane Jones' son—thank goodness he was bigger than me, because I would not have been much protection for him, I have to admit. The interesting thing about it was that the guy who was right in my face there, being probably the loudest, is a guy whom I have subsequently worked with on other issues and find him quite a nice chap.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 12:44:57" ></a><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member.

I would like, firstly, to acknowledge the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, the Hon Christopher Finlayson; the Māori Affairs Committee; and the chair of the select committee, my colleague and friend Nuk Korako, for their excellent work in getting this bill to this stage. I would like to extend the dialogue that my colleague Nuk Korako introduced when he was making his contribution, around the work of the select committee. The select committee had 18 submissions, and, it is fair to say, a number were opposed on a number of issues. Those issues included hapū ownership versus iwi, and the mandate in overlapping boundaries—issues that we have seen in other Treaty settlements. As my colleague commented, questions were raised around the participation rate, and others have also said the same—that at 30.9 percent, is that a number that is valid? As it has been noted, as we look across other deeds of settlements and other post-settlement governance entities (PSGE), it actually sits in that mid-range.</p><p class="a">I want to drill down a bit, just to give some sense of depth as to how detailed the reach-out to the community was. There were 7 weeks of ratification process. There were four ratification hui. Voting was open for 10 weeks and 5 days. It was advertised in local papers, major national papers, local radios, email lists, and Facebook, and, as has been commented, 2,426 voting packs were sent out. The participation rate of 30.9 percent was across the deeds of settlement and PSGE.</p><p class="a">I think that what also came through and was part of the select committee hearings was the claimant definition, which is jointly established by iwi and the Crown, and that definition was retained from when the mandate was first established 15 years previously—that is, the claimant definition is the descendants of Kahukuraariki, or any other recognised ancestor of the group, defined in Part 8 of the deed of settlement.</p><p class="a">To review, Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa went through the tribunal process in the 1990s, and the tribunal found that Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa's claims were well-founded claims and recommended a settlement negotiation. The Ngatikahu ki Whangaroa Trust Board sought and obtained a mandate from the Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa claimant community.</p><p class="a">What a beacon of light this iwi is in Northland. I will make no mileage of the discourse of the past 24 hours in this House. I will make no mileage of the confused major iwi at their boundary. The mileage this iwi wants to make is to move forward, and I say to them: "Keep moving." Which iwi will be the first to have settlement in the east coast of Northland? It will be Ngāti Kahu ki Whangaroa. Again, please, I say to ngā iwi katoa "Keep moving.", and with our love and support, that is exactly what will happen. Nō reira, Mr Assistant Speaker, tēnā koutou, kia ora mai tātou.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="BillDebate"><strong>RANGITĀNE O MANAWATU CLAIMS SETTLEMENT BILL</strong></p><p class="SubDebate"><strong>Second Reading</strong></p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160922 12:49:14" ></a><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON (Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations)</strong>: I move, <em>That the </em><em>Rangitāne</em><em> o </em><em>Manawatu</em><em> Claims Settlement Bill be now read a second time</em>. The bill gives effect to a deed of settlement between the Crown and Rangitāne o Manawatu that was signed in November last year, and that settles all the historical Treaty of Waitangi claims relating to Rangitāne. I remember the signing ceremony very well. It was in front of the beautiful whare of Rangitāne in Palmerston North, and in front of the whare there is this big pou, and there are two people on it, at the very top. One is the Rt Hon Sir Douglas Graham, who was the Minister in charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, and, believe it or not, staring vacantly into space, is the Rt Hon Winston Peters. I do not know whether he knows he is on that pou. I think it is a very good place for him to be, because, basically, he has been up a pou most of the morning. </p><p class="a">The settlement comprises historical redress, which records the breaches and the past injustices caused by failures of the Crown; cultural redress, recognising the traditional, historical, cultural, and spiritual associations of the people of Rangitāne with a number of their most special sites; and financial and commercial redress, which reasserts the role of Rangitāne in the region. Rangitāne and the Crown have worked very well together to develop a settlement package that reconnects Rangitāne with its environment and that provides a good, strong economic base for the iwi to grow. </p><p class="a">Can I acknowledge the excellent work of the Rangitāne negotiators, particularly Danielle Harris, who worked so very long and hard on this matter; my ministerial colleagues; and Government and other agencies who have contributed to the bill. As always—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Rt Hon Winst</strong><strong>on </strong><strong>Peters</strong>: And her mother.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER </strong><strong>FINLAYSON</strong>: Oh, that is a fair enough point, actually—and Ruth Harris, who passed away some years ago, who started the matter off and did a very good job. I thank the right honourable member for one constructive contribution this morning. </p><p class="a">As always, I want to thank and acknowledge the work of the Māori Affairs Committee, which, once again, has done an excellent job in progressing this bill in a timely manner. The committee began its consideration of the bill only in May and considered nine submissions from interested groups and individuals, and they heard from five submitters at a hearing in Palmerston North. The committee reported the bill back to the House early this month and recommended it be passed with very minor changes—they are of a technical nature, and I am really pleased that that is the case. </p><p class="a">Rangitāne has done a great job. They chose a pragmatic approach to the redress they were seeking, focusing on their core area of interest, and they conducted an open and robust overlapping claims resolution process. The bill, with its very limited number of amendments, is a testament to the hard work of the negotiators. In its report, the committee commended how overlapping claims issues were addressed during negotiations and noted that "this settlement seeks to balance the interests of all iwi in the area, with the underpinning rationale that commercial redress is intended to contribute to re-establishing an iwi's economic base." This perfectly captures what is intended through each Treaty settlement negotiation. It describes—and indeed it was here, with the discussions that took place—the fine line that has to be walked between addressing the longstanding grievances of one group and giving them the means to move forward, while ensuring that we are not creating further grievances with surrounding groups. </p><p class="a">One issue raised in the submissions, and it has confronted the Rangitāne negotiations since the process began, is the inclusion of the Ngāti Tauira hapū in the Rangitāne claimant definition, a very difficult issue. The committee accepted that Ngāti Tauira's primary affiliation is with Ngāti Apa, but found that "Ngāti Tauira clearly has whakapapa, social, and political links to both groups." I believe this settles this matter once and for all. Ultimately, members of this particular hapū have the option to benefit from either or both settlements, as long as they descend from the respective tupuna. </p><p class="a">Finally, some submitters stated that although the settlement does not fully compensate Rangitāne for the injustices of the past, it provides an opportunity for the iwi to find some peace with the past and a path to the future, and I certainly hope that that is the case. This bill signifies an end point to the long process of negotiation for Rangitāne, and it is now time to find some measure of peace and look to the future. </p><p class="a">I am going to leave my final thanks to the Rangitāne negotiating team until the third reading. However, before I end, I want to acknowledge the patience of the negotiators, who must be anxious to reach their settlement of these historical claims after so many, many years in negotiation. I want to assure them—and I am sure that everyone in this House shares this view—that we want to see a just and durable settlement for Rangitāne o Manawatu as soon as possible. So I look forward to the third reading of the bill and commend this bill to the House.</p></div></body>

I acknowledge the contribution of the Minister, the Hon Chris Finlayson. The name of the whare in Palmerston North is Tūturu Pūmau. The pou that stands there has a number of other figures. I want to mention one. I started off during other contributions talking about ngā poropititanga, and on that marae we have a tribute to Mere Rikiriki, a very important poropiti, and Tahupōtiki Wīremu Rātana. I want to acknowledge the contributions that both of them had to the history of Rangitāne. It is important to mention that. It is, of course, a beautiful marae there, and it was a pleasure for me to also attend the signing of the deed of settlement. </p><p class="a">I too will acknowledge Danielle Harris and her tenacity, which she, obviously, inherited from her mother, Ruth Harris. I think I mentioned this in the first reading. When I was the chair of Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Apa, we often sat opposite each other at tables on various matters, and both of them are formidable. I want to acknowledge the work that Danielle has done to get this bill into the House. </p><p class="a">Also I acknowledge Maurice Takarangi as well and all of the team behind them who have done such wonderful work. It was not easy for them, and it was not easy for Ngāti Apa, but I think that through the select committee process, on the key issue that the Minister has raised, they have come to a happy place. Might I say, it might not be what each individual iwi wanted, but from my view of the world, as an uri of Rangitauira, a descendant of Rangitauira, I am very happy to be part of a hapū that has, basically, got two settlements. It is quite a rarity. And if the Crown wants to do that, that is fine with me. </p><p class="a">So within the settlement, of course, like the other settlements that we have discussed and debated in the House today, this particular one also addresses a sad history around the interaction between the iwi and the Crown, and the Crown's inability at that time to address all of the issues. So we come today with a determination that this bill will move forward. I acknowledge that people were expecting this to be passed into law tomorrow. It is unfortunate that it is not happening now.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Debate interrupted.</p><p class="CentredEndingBold"><strong>The House adjourned at 1 p.m. (Thursday)</strong></p></div></body>
