							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="BillDebate"><strong>NGĀRUAHINE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT BILL</strong></p><p class="SubDebate"><strong>Second Reading</strong></p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160629 09:02:09" ></a><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON (Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations)</strong>: I move, <em>That the Ngāruahine Claims Settlement Bill be now read a second time</em>. The bill gives effect to a deed of settlement between the Crown and Ngāruahine that was signed near Hāwera in August 2014. The settlement provides financial, commercial, and cultural redress and acknowledges the losses suffered by Ngāruahine arising from very serious breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. </p><p class="a">I acknowledge the work of the negotiators, some of whom are present in the gallery this morning, my ministerial colleagues, and Government and other agencies that have contributed to this bill. I also want to thank the chair and members of the Māori Affairs Committee for their good work during the consideration of the bill and the exploration of the issues raised in submissions. </p><p class="a">The bill was referred to the committee on 11 August 2015, 24 submissions were received from interested groups and individuals, and the committee heard 12 of these at hearings in Hāwera and Wellington in November 2015. The committee reported the bill back to the House on 23 March 2016 and recommended that it be passed with a number of amendments, which include changes to clauses relating to fines for offences under regulations and by-laws, the inclusion of new Part 4 to the bill to provide a mechanism for Ngāruahine to reorganise their governance structure in relation to their fisheries assets, and other minor or technical amendments that are not specifically referenced in the committee's commentary on the bill. </p><p class="a">There is one particular matter that I want to refer to now. In its commentary on the bill, the committee went to some lengths to address Āraukuku interests covered under a claim to the Waitangi Tribunal, registered as Wai 552. This was a key issue raised by submitters opposing the bill. It is the subject of judicial review proceedings on appeal to the Court of Appeal and is set down for hearing on 19 July. Āraukuku is a Taranaki hapū that has whakapapa links both to Ngāti Ruanui and Ngāruahine. </p><p class="a">The committee noted in its commentary that although the claims settlement process does not allow it to address to its satisfaction the issues that some Āraukuku individuals raised in submissions, it does not propose any changes to the bill and will continue to monitor the situation through the Post Settlement Commitments Unit. On the related issue of the Stratford Power Station land, I acknowledge the committee's request for the Crown to make public statements in respect of this land, and I will certainly consider that at the appropriate time. </p><p class="a">The other matter raised by the committee in its commentary related to concerns raised by Ngāruahine regarding the appropriateness of transferring future or contingent liabilities from their mandated iwi organisation to their post-settlement governance entity, as provided for through the governance reorganisation provisions of the bill. I understand that although the post-settlement governance entity accepts the need to take on all known current assets and liabilities, they are concerned about unknown future or contingent liabilities that result from acts or omissions by their mandated iwi organisation up until the date it is wound up. </p><p class="a">Although the committee is not recommending any amendments to the bill in relation to future or contingent liabilities based on Crown advice, my officials agreed to look into this issue in more detail on a without prejudice basis, and I am going to write to Ngāruahine very shortly. </p><p class="a">The second reading brings us closer to the concluding stages of the settlement process. It seeks to recognise what is important to the people of Ngāruahine and to provide redress for historical breaches of the Treaty. My hope is to host the iwi of Taranaki here in Wellington in October for a joint Ngāruahine, Te Atiawa, and Taranaki Iwi third reading. I commend the bill to the House.</p></div></body>

Oti noa, mai i Te Rakiura ki Te Tonga, whiti atu ki Te Wharekauri ki Te Rāwhiti, toro atu ki Taranaki ki Te Uru, piki atu ki Te Reinga ki Te Tai Tokerau, ngā kokonga e whā o Te Motu o Aotearoa, ngā whānau i raro i te kapua pouri, kei te hīkoi i roto i te ātārangi o ngā whārua o te mate; mauri mai rā ō koutou parekawakawa kia tangihia e te wā iti nei.

Nō reira oti atu te wā ki a koutou, e oki, e oki.</p><p class="a">Nō reira, e tika 'oki kia 'uri atu ki ngā whānau me ngā hapū o Ngāruahine, koutou katoa kua tae mai ki tēnei Whare ki te w'akarongo ki te pānuitanga tuarua o tēnei pire. Nau mai, haere mai, whakatau mai rā, ā, tēnā koutou.</p><p class="a">[<em>So the first thing is that I rise to endorse the voice that gave the prayer; therefore, to you elder brother colleague who delivered that prayer, well done. Accordingly, from Stewart Island to the South, across to the Chatham Islands in the East, extending to western Taranaki, and up to Te Reinga to the North—the four corners of the nation of New Zealand—to those families shrouded in a cloud of sadness and walking in the shadow of the valley of death, bring forth your garland of greenery so that we may mourn in this brief period. This is a lament of grief, my parapet and my shield; the dread of the multitude, the vessel of death is afloat. And so to you the many deaths of the moment return spiritually to the unseen place, and the time for you is at an end; return, go back.</em></p><p class="a"><em>It is fitting, as well, to turn to the families and subtribes of Ngāruahine, to all of you who have arrived at this House to listen to the second reading of this bill. Welcome, come forth, draw closer, and greetings to you collectively.</em>]</p><p class="a">It gives me great pleasure to speak in the second reading of this, the Ngāruahine Claims Settlement Bill. I had the pleasure of sitting on the Māori Affairs Committee for this bill, and I want to acknowledge all of the submitters who made submissions in support of this settlement bill. There were some submissions that did stand out for me, and I just want to acknowledge one in particular. It was the submission by Peter Moeahu, who told us about when this process started and reflected on the changes within his own family. He spoke about the fact that at the time that this settlement first started he had one mokopuna—one grandchild—and at the select committee stage I think he had at least nine, from memory, and several great-grandchildren as well. That, for me, expressed how this settlement—because this is what he told us—was about his future generations, not for himself, and I think that reflected the sentiments from a number of submitters that it was about the future.</p><p class="a">If we also look at the summary of the historical account—I'll read the first sentence: "Before 1860, Ngāruahine were prosperous and economically successful, and retained the ownership of their lands and resources after consistently opposing the sale of land in their rohe to Europeans." That first sentence tells us a lot about the history of when the breaches of the Treaty started. So in 1860 Ngāruahine were prosperous and economically successful. Peter Moeahu talked about the future of his family and his hapū, and I wanted to reflect on from 1860 till now. A lot has happened to diminish the prosperity and economic success of Ngāruahine. Only yesterday we found out through a report that talks about the prosperity of our own people, whereby the majority of assets in this country are owned by only 10 percent and that 10 percent does not include Māori, or many Māori, at all, or Pasifika as well. I wanted to mention that because I think that gives us some context around why we have these settlement bills come into this House. </p><p class="a">This settlement is an opportunity for Ngāruahine to start turning round their lack of prosperity, the lack of economic success for their tribe. I think that it would be remiss of me not to mention that in comparison with others, Māori have an average of only $23,000 worth of assets, Pasifika have only $12,000, and European/Pākehā have $114,000 worth of assets on average. So there is huge disparity in our country today. I think, hopefully, that Ngāruahine can take this settlement and build on potential future success so that their people can live in prosperity.</p><p class="a">There were also some submitters who did not agree with the settlement, and the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi negotiations has mentioned that, and I too wanted to mention Āraukuku. In a way it has been quite an unfortunate process for Āraukuku, but on reflection on all of the evidence, despite their concerns, the committee acknowledged those concerns. The Āraukuku hapū were included in the Ngati Ruanui settlement in 2003, and not all of the Āraukuku people agreed with that settlement, but there was not, in the opinion of the select committee, the scope to allow a discrete settlement for Āraukuku. Those members of Āraukuku who whakapapa to Ngāruahine can still participate within the Ngāruahine settlement under the relevant hapū that they whakapapa to. So although it is an unfortunate series of events and is still going through a judicial process, it is important, I think, that we acknowledge that they did make submissions.</p><p class="a">There is also the actual settlement itself, and I mentioned the financial redress, which is by no means the most important issue. I think probably more important are the cultural redress items that were within the settlement, and they are significant. I want to acknowledge both the iwi and the negotiators of this settlement for their tenacity in getting such a good settlement, both financially in the commercial redress and under the apology and the cultural redress items as well. It could not have been an easy process to go through, and I want to acknowledge all the good work that they did.</p><p class="a">Nō reira, tēnei ahau tētehi uri o Ngāwakataurua e tuku mi'i atu anō ki aku whanaunga kua tae mai, otirā, ki ngā whānau me ngā hapū katoa. Ki a au nei, ko te tūmanako kia pai haere ngā āhuatanga e pā ana ki tēnei pire. Kua tata te wā ki te mutunga o tēnei whakahaerenga, oti noa, he tīmatanga tēnei. Nō reira, kei te mi'i atu ki a koutou o Ngāruahine oti noa, ki ngā mema o Te Whare nei, ā, tēnā tātou katoa. </p><p class="a">[<em>Therefore, I, one of the descendants of Ngāwakataurua, welcome you once again my relatives but at the same time the families and all the subtribes that have arrived. For me personally I hope that aspects relating to this bill will continue to improve. The time for this process to end is near, but it is only the beginning. And so, congratulations to you of Ngāruahine, but at the same time, members of this House, my regards to us all</em><em>.</em>]</p></div></body>

In this second reading I want to focus on the work of the Māori Affairs Committee in relation to this bill. Our role on the select committee is to listen to submissions, seek official advice, and recommend any amendments that would improve the bill before us. We received quite a number of submissions on this bill, many of those from Ngāruahine members and expressing strong support for the bill itself. I particularly noted the understanding that submitters showed in acknowledging the settlement that it would not, and could not, make up for everything that was lost in the past. We have seen this with many Treaty settlement bills that have come before this House, but, like the many bills before this one, Ngāruahine also have a sense of optimism about the fact that what comes out of this settlement is the opportunity for Ngāruahine to build itself an economic base for the future that will allow it to provide greater opportunities for its people. </p><p class="a">I particularly want to—and my colleague Adrian Rurawhe actually quoted this in his speech. I want to acknowledge Mr Rurawhe, as well, because he is not a permanent member of the Māori Affairs Committee, but during the early stages of this bill and particularly when we went to Hāwera to listen to the submissions, Mr Rurawhe was there to assist the committee, particularly from a local perspective. But I want to also mention Mr Peter Moeahu because Mr Moeahu, who has been very active in Treaty settlements right across the area, particularly in Taranaki, will also be the chair of Te Korowai o Ngāruahine trust, which is the organisation tasked with administering this settlement on behalf of Ngāruahine. Mr Moeahu has been involved, as I said, in Treaty claims for quite some time, but I want to read from Mr Moeahu's written submission, as I feel that these words are a reminder of how important this work of Treaty settlement negotiations is and the profound effect that a settlement has, not just in the commercial redress but through the issuing of a formal apology from the Crown for its misdeeds. </p><p class="a">In Mr Moeahu's words, when he was speaking during his appearance before the tribunal, this is what he said: "At that hearing I presented my 7 children and my first grand child to the Tribunal and said, 'This is who the Crown steals from.' Today on behalf of my 7 children, 14 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren I say this is who the Crown settles with. I also said in 1990, 'When I look at a map of Taranaki and trace the Confiscation Line, it is an arrow piercing the heart of my people'. This Bill removes that arrow and the apology and small measure of redress contained therein, will help heal the wound caused by the Crowns grievous actions." In the 1990 tribunal hearing, this is what he said: "if the Crown chose the right path to the settlement peace would reign. The Ngaruahine Claims Settlement Bill is the right path." </p><p class="a">Not all submissions on the bill were positive, though. Some individuals descending from Āraukuku hapū have raised their concerns in relation to this bill. Āraukuku has links to both Ngāti Ruanui and Ngāruahine. They were included in the claimant definition of the Ngāti Ruanui settlement based on their own decision to participate in the settlement itself. However, some individuals disagree with the hapū decision to throw its lot in with Ngāti Ruanui, and we heard from some who would like a discrete settlement for Āraukuku. As a result of these submissions, the committee sought confirmation that Āraukuku individuals who whakapapa to Ngāruahine will be able to benefit from the settlement, and we are assured that that will be. We were not satisfied that we were able to fully address the concerns of these individuals as part of this settlement bill, but it is clear that Āraukuku hapū has already settled with the Crown as a part of Ngāti Ruanui. But one thing that the committee did resolve is that it will continue to monitor the situation through the Post Settlement Commitments Unit to ensure that individuals are treated fairly. </p><p class="a">The other amendments we have recommended are largely administrative matters concerning the reorganisation of the iwi's governance after the settlement. The mandated group Ngā Hapū o Ngāruahine Iwi Inc. will hand over its responsibilities, assets, and liabilities to the post-settlement entity Te Korowai o Ngāruahine Trust. Our recommended amendments ensure that this happens smoothly, and we did spend a lot of time actually looking at that transition from one entity to the post-settlement entity. </p><p class="a">I want to acknowledge those of Ngāruahine who are here today, and also those who cannot be here but who are actually watching live broadcasting from this House. I also want to acknowledge, as Mr Rurawhe also did, those who have passed on and did not actually see what is almost the final continuation—to this point, rather; to the second reading—through the Committee stage, and to the third, final reading. I look forward to discussing this bill further, in the Committee stage and the third reading. Again, it reflects the pragmatic and principled way that I believe that my committee operates as the Māori Affairs Committee. On that note, I would like to commend this bill to the House. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

So acknowledgments indeed to you, welcome into this House, the House of the nation, and welcome. I am pleased that we have reached this part, the second reading, and presently this matter will be completed. The desire is that the benefits are bestowed upon you, your grandchildren, and kin; and so, well done.</em>]</p><p class="a">Like my colleague Adrian Rurawhe, I would like to quickly go over some of the historical account because it always puts into context what we are just discussing here. As Adrian Rurawhe has said, before 1860 Ngāruahine were a prosperous and economically successful iwi. It was only a matter of years later—about 5 years later—that the Crown began its programme of confiscation of land throughout the Taranaki area. Some 1.2 million acres of land was confiscated, and Ngāruahine, in the end, was basically left landless. </p><p class="a">We really need to take stock of what that actually means—the forces of the Crown just turning up and shifting people off their land, taking their land. We can imagine if that happened these days—if the New Zealand Army turned up in a township and basically said to everybody: "Sorry, this place is no longer yours. We're coming along, we're bulldozing your houses, we're bulldozing your gardens, your supermarkets, your schools, and everything. Off you go, and, by the way, we expect you to become successful and to develop yourselves, despite the fact that we've taken all your resources." If that was to happen these days all hell would break loose, but in those days it was fairly well accepted. Ngāruahine have been fighting that since the 1860s, and that is what has brought us here today. </p><p class="a">We need to recognise that some of that land was returned. There was 26,000 acres that was eventually returned to Ngāruahine as reserves, but the Crown retained over 145,000 acres of Ngāruahine land. That land that was returned, but it was not returned as a big parcel to the whole iwi. It was, in fact, individualised. This is just another way that the Crown has managed to alienate iwi, hapū, and whānau from their land—by returning it under individual title, where it is easily picked off and sold off. In effect, it is just another way of confiscating land. It was easy then for settlers to acquire that land, probably because many of the whānau had debts to pay after having had their land taken off them and not being able to afford to support themselves economically. The best way that they could get some money to support themselves was to sell their land. Of course they sold the land and still they were no better off. </p><p class="a">It is important that we set the context for what we are talking about here, and I have said that before. It is quite coincidental that whenever we are talking about Treaty settlements, groups of schoolkids come in. It is important that they know this is what—come into the gallery, I mean. It is important that they hear this sort of story so that they know the true history and what has really happened to our people. Again, I will reiterate the claim that this sort of history needs to be taught in our schools. </p><p class="a">People have touched on the Āraukuku situation—by the way, I have a map here and it gives people a bit more context. If we look at a map of Taranaki, Ngāruahine are the iwi with the land directly to the south of Mount Taranaki. To their east is Ngāti Ruanui. So they are two iwi, side by side, sharing adjacent—in fact, overlapping—boundaries, and Āraukuku are a hapū that are right on that boundary. The people of Āraukuku are descended from both Ngāruahine and Ngāti Ruanui, and that is where some of the confusion—I am sorry. I should not say "confusion", because they know who they are. But that is where some of the confusion lies for those of us who are not from the area where the overlapping interests occur. </p><p class="a">So there were some people who opposed Āraukuku's settlement, and they wanted their own individual settlement, which in itself is problematic. It is believed that Āraukuku's interests were settled, basically, entirely under the Ngāti Ruanui settlement. The Āraukuku opponents of the Ngāruahine claimant definition apparently did not respond to a Crown offer to facilitate hui between themselves and Ngāruahine to address their participation in the Ngāruahine settlement. These Āraukuku individuals were apparently unable to demonstrate a significant level of support among Āraukuku or that they had a mandate to represent the hapū. </p><p class="a">I have some empathy because I know how intricate our whakapapa are, and someone coming from Ngāpuhi is in no position to judge the relationships and the whakapapa and the whole situation. So I do have some empathy for Āraukuku. However, in the end we have decided that Āraukuku interests have been addressed. </p><p class="a">I will just move on to some of the recommended changes in the bill. As the chairperson of the Māori Affairs Committee has said, it is largely administrative. There is a new Part 4 to the bill, and that provides a mechanism for reorganising the various governance bodies established by Ngāruahine. The liabilities transfer from Ngā Hapū o Ngāruahine, which is the very group that has brought things this far, and they are going to be transferred to Te Korowai o Ngāruahine Trust. </p><p class="a">The bill also sets out new clause 128, which dissolves that current representative group of Ngā Hapū o Ngāruahine. New clause 129(1) vests the assets and liabilities of Ngā Hapū o Ngāruahine Iwi Inc. as the assets and liabilities of the trustees of Te Korowai o Ngāruahine Trust. </p><p class="a">There was some issue over clause 127(1)(b)(ii) of the bill, where Te Korowai o Ngāruahine Trust was concerned about the unknown level of future or contingent liabilities. We understood that any change to clause 127(1)(b)(ii) would be a significant departure from the Crown's current policy on assets and liabilities. The officials recommended that it remain. New clause 130 provides arrangements for the subsidiary Ngāruahine Fisheries Ltd to no longer be a tax charity for the purposes of tax legislation. </p><p class="a">That is the tenor of most of the changes. It is more administrative, but as we are dealing with these mainly administrative issues we always need to keep in context why and how we have got to this stage, and it really does come from the historical account. </p><p class="a">We have heard that whānau have said: "When we started this journey I had just one mokopuna; now we have many." So we really to need to acknowledge that this is for those many mokopuna. We need to also remember and acknowledge those people who started this journey but who are, sadly, no longer with us. Their work is creating a new future direction for their mokopuna. With that, I look forward to the Committee stage and recommend this bill to the House. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

I would like to start by acknowledging my good friend and colleague Nuk Korako and his very gracious contribution and comment towards two of leaders in Te Tai Tokerau who have fallen recently: Charlie Pētera and Sir Graham Latimer. I would like to add to that list Rob Cooper, if I may, and I would say to Rob: E Rob, haere, haere, haere! Haere ki te kāinga tūturu o tō tātou Matua i Te Rangi; moe mai, moe mai, moe mai.</p><p class="a">[<em>Rob, depart, journey on, farewell! Go forth to the true heavenly home of our Father in the Sky; sleep, lie, and rest there</em><em>.</em>]</p><p class="a">It is a pleasure to speak to this bill, and when I speak to bills of this sort I often like to just summarise in my own mind the progress that brings us to this point, and add to the dialogue that our colleagues from across the House have already laid down. This bill talks to Ngāruahine, which is one of eight Taranaki iwi, with a population of around about 3,800 people. The traditional lands for Ngāruahine are South Taranaki, encompassing Egmont National Park and extending from Taungatara Stream at the northernmost boundary to the Waihī Stream at the southernmost boundary.</p><p class="a">As I look at this bill I am often inclined to go to the final paragraph in each of the acknowledgments because I find, for me, it conveys some tone and mood of what all the preceding narrative has described. So I would like to start by first of all going to the summary of historical account. The final statement here reads as follows: "During the 20th century, Crown efforts to address Taranaki Māori grievances failed to do so. Some inquiries were limited in their scope, and others provided for compensation payments that were not discussed with Ngāruahine and other Taranaki Māori. The Taranaki Maori Claims Settlement Act 1944 stated that the sums were a full settlement of claims relating to the confiscations and Parihaka. There is no evidence that Ngāruahine or other iwi agreed to this."</p><p class="a">Similarly, if we turn to the acknowledgments, the final stanza for the acknowledgments also conveys mood and tone of what is intended in this settlement. It reads as follows: "The Crown acknowledges that its breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles during the 19th and 20th centuries have together significantly undermined the traditional systems of authority and economic capacity of the Ngāruahine iwi, and the physical, cultural, and spiritual well-being of its people. The Crown acknowledges that it has failed to protect the rangatiratanga of Ngāruahine, in breach of its obligations under Article Two of the Treaty of Waitangi."</p><p class="a">The apology concludes thus: "The Crown hopes that this settlement and this apology will relieve the burden of grievance that Ngāruahine has carried for so many years, and will assist Ngāruahine to heal the wounds of the past. The Crown looks forward to building a relationship of mutual trust and co-operation with Ngāruahine founded on respect for the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles."</p><p class="a">A full settlement like this, of courses, includes cultural redress, and the cultural redress here talks about providing recognition of the traditional, historical, cultural, and spiritual association of Ngāruahine with places and sites owned by the Crown within their primary area of interest. This allows Ngāruahine and the Crown to protect and enhance the conservation values associated with these sites. The financial redress has been well commented on before. It is a sum of money, $67.5 million, in recognition of all the historical claims.</p><p class="a">Finally, the collective redress is also a nice piece of work and I want to commend the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations for bringing this part of the agreement together, particularly, and I want to talk to that. The collective redress elements of the settlement have been negotiated between the Crown and Ngāruahine, Te Atiawa, and Taranaki iwi. Each iwi stressed its strong associations with all of the natural resources within its rohe and its desire to achieve more positive environmental outcomes for the Taranaki region. The deed of settlement sets out a proposed model for iwi representation on the two standing committees in the Taranaki Regional Council that perform the roles and functions associated with policy, planning, and consents. This is a settlement that goes beyond focusing just on the iwi. It also focuses on their relationships, their boundaries, and their interface with other iwi, and particularly with parts of their natural environment, which, of course, is very important to Māori. This settlement is an excellent settlement. It is well-thought-out. It has had a lot of work and continues to have work through the Māori Affairs Committee. It is my absolute pleasure to commend this bill to the House.</p></div></body>

I started as an MP in November last year, and so I want to pay special acknowledgment to this Ngāruahine claim because this was my very first hearing in my role as spokesperson for Māori development for the Green Party—the Ngāruahine claim.</p><p class="a">I was still fluffing around, trying to figure out what on earth I do in this place. I was heavily endowed with the honour of being the Māori Affairs Committee member for the Green Party. It is an incredible committee and an incredible privilege to be part of this committee, which tries to do the best and make the best laws for our Māori people. So here I was. Like all of us MPs, I followed the directions in my diary on my phone, got told what plane to catch and where to drive to. I landed in a part of the country that I knew very little about. I followed the directions and followed "Auntie Google" to get me to Hāwera. I arrived in Hāwera. This was my very first Treaty hearing experience as a very, very new MP. I did not know what to expect—I did not know what to expect. I was carrying an incredible sense of responsibility to do the best job I could as the Green Party representative, and to hear what the people were going to say.</p><p class="a">I rocked up to the Hāwera stadium place. There was the big panel. We had all been given seats, and we had our lovely gold-embossed little name tablets and everything up there. I was late. I was late, and there was my name sitting there, with no Marama behind it. So I tried to sneak in sideways and inconspicuously, to take my seat and sit down. Luckily in Te Ao Māori the pōwhiri and the mihi often take up a little bit of our beautiful time—that is, Māori time. So I still managed to sit down in time to stand up again to give my whakapapa and introduce myself.</p><p class="a">And then I sat and I listened to, I think it was about 12 submissions that day. I remember Peter Moeahu, who is the inaugural chair of the mandated body Te Korowai o Ngāruahine, which is going to take the claim forward. Like everybody else, I cracked up when he talked about starting the claim with one mokopuna and ending it with, I think it was, 14 and with some great-grandchildren. You know, although that was a beautiful story to indicate the length of time, I was also thinking that in my family that could be 1 year, ha, ha! But it was a beautiful story to indicate not just time but how our whakapapa moves and grows through the hearings of these settlements. They do take a while. We have children, we have grandchildren, and we lose our people at the other end as well, our kaumātua—sometimes the very ones who started off these kōrero. So I wanted to acknowledge everybody involved in these fraught processes.</p><p class="a">These Tiriti settlement claims are fraught every time. If there is one thing I learnt really quickly, coming into Parliament and being on this committee and hearing settlement claims, it is that every time they are fraught. Māori have done fabulously in trying to get anything happening and trying to get anything moving, with how fraught these processes are. This is where I also want to acknowledge all of those who also opposed this bill, including Āraukuku, who were very clear. The submitters who came to us were very clear that they wanted to align in the Ngāruahine settlement, and they felt excluded from this settlement because it was said that the Crown basically mandated that they were already part of the Ngāti Ruanui settlement. So we heard that as well. I want to acknowledge that.</p><p class="a">Yes, I too, like my colleague from Te Tai Tokerau, Kelvin Davis, am not one to stand here and pass any sort of judgment over the wedges between hapū and across iwi that arise in Treaty settlements. I cannot imagine what I am going to say when my iwi turn up here, when Ngāpuhi turns up here, in the House—I cannot even imagine. But it is still important for me to acknowledge the sincerity with which every submitter brought their mamae, their joy, their range of emotions and stories to us on the select committee.</p><p class="a">I will pick up, for example, from a submission from Allie Hemara-Wahanui, who supports the bill, who said: "While the settlement barely compensates Ngaruahine Iwi for the injustices of the past, it provides the opportunity to implement the aspirations outlined in our 25 year iwi strategy 2009-2034." I am always amazed by our people in these settlements. On the continuum you have got people genuinely doing their best to move their iwi and hapū and whānau forward—negotiators, kaumātua, marae, and hapū engaging in these really fraught conversations—because you can never settle the injustices. They are never settled, and these claims are not just about a settlement. They are ongoing, enduring relationships and we need to be very clear about that. [<em>Bell rung</em>] Oh, already, Mr Assistant Speaker—all right then. They are ongoing, enduring relationships.</p><p class="a">I have quoted Allie as an example of the aspirations, and I will also quote how Āraukuku felt that this was a monumental Crown blunder and that our Māori have to deal with this process, which sets hapū, marae, and iwi against each other, resulting from something that the Crown did to us, and yet it is Māori who end up having these difficult, fraught conversations. I want to acknowledge our people for trying to do the best that we can. I will finish on the fact that Te Tiriti was a relationship with hapū, and it was set up, and that is partly why trying to settle with iwi is fraught. Ngāruahine ngā mihi ki a koutou katoa, tēnā tātou. Kia ora.</p><p>[<em>Ngāruahine, acknowledgments to you all and to all of us. Thank you.</em>]</p></div></body>

Therefore, and according to the saying: "Theirs is the night and ours is the morning." And so I acknowledge, commend, and congratulate you collectively</em><em>.</em>]</p><p class="a">I take some delight in participating in this debate, particularly in terms of seeing another Treaty claim settlement come before the House on its way to being enacted, and therefore allowing the claimants to leave this House knowing that essentially what they have asked for has been resolved—not entirely, but certainly resolved to a great extent. In this case we are talking about the claim from the Ngāruahine Claims Settlement Bill. I sat on the Māori Affairs Committee, where we heard a number of submissions, and can I say that I certainly support that process because it allows those who do not necessarily agree with the terms of settlement that have been reached to certainly air their concerns, and for us, as politicians, to hear and to consider. </p><p class="a">First of all, I want to say that this bill is one of a number that addresses some of the—in my view—serious breaches of the Treaty in the history of our country, particularly in terms of the loss of life, displacement of a people, and the results of all of that. It is articulated in the bill as to what happened, and we all know that before 1860, 20 years after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, this iwi was one of the most prosperous and economically successful iwi in the region—some would probably say "in New Zealand" at the time, but I am from the north, so I probably have a different view in that respect. However, the fact is that there is no question about the economic position of Ngāruahine at the time. So the invasion of Crown troops has led to this claim being made before the Waitangi Tribunal, and we all know the history involved in that. </p><p class="a">The Māori Affairs Committee's report makes reference to the Āraukuku issue, and, again, like my colleague Kelvin Davis, who am I to question the position that Āraukuku has taken? Given the whakapapa links between that hapū or iwi to that of the claimant group today, that is something that will always be an issue for us as Māori, who both have a concern about claims and do not agree with the claims, but at least we have been assured that anyone from Āraukuku who is descended from their tūpuna is able to benefit from this particular claim. Some members of Āraukuku did not support that decision and they campaigned for a discrete settlement for their iwi or hapū—whatever we might want to describe them as. They wanted their own autonomy, their own rangatiratanga. </p><p class="a">Some members disagree with the exclusion of Āraukuku from the list of hapū in the Ngāruahine claimant definition. The Crown has previously stated that Āraukuku's settlement alignment was for the hapū to resolve, and to a certain extent I agree with that, only as long as the Crown has not been responsible for that position, and some would argue that it has been. The select committee has been assured by Ngāruahine that Āraukuku individuals with Ngāruahine whakapapa are able to benefit from the Ngāruahine settlement. The settlement process does not allow for the committee to address the concerns of Āraukuku satisfactorily, and I, in this part of this debate, certainly support that notion. </p><p class="a">The other issue that was raised was in regard to the Stratford Power Station. The land was confiscated during the 1860s and awarded to Āraukuku after the raupatu as part of a reserve, but subsequently became privately owned. As the Crown will not give privately owned land, the committee would like to have the Crown produce public statements to accompany this settlement bill. The Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations has assured this House that he will certainly do that. </p><p class="a">I just want to make some comments about the submissions. A large proportion of those who submitted certainly supported the bill. In regard to the Kanihi hapū, and I quote from their submission, "… throughout the entire treaty settlement process every effort was made by the Nga Hapu board, and the negotiator(s) to ensure that everyone regardless of whether they were registered members of Nga Hapu or otherwise were kept informed by way of various mediums, i.e., panui, hui, website, email etc.". So that confirms that every effort was made to inform the beneficiaries of this claim. </p><p class="a">However, some of the issues that were raised by the submitters—I want to mention them because one or two of them do have, for me, some validity. Ngāti Tū did not support the Ngāruahine-mandated collective—Ngā Hapū o Ngāruahine Iwi Inc.—and subsequently do not support the negotiated settlement. They believe that the settlement suffers from the same issues identified with my people from the Tai Tokerau, Ngāpuhi, and the issue of the Tūhoronuku Independent Mandated Authority. Another submitter was Democracy Action. It quite clearly stated that it opposed clauses 85 and 86, relating to cultural redress and iwi representation on council committees. This clause is something that is imposed on the people of that local body area, who have been denied the right to elect who should be sitting on their council committees. That is a concern that has been expressed not only in terms of this claim but also as a consequence of other claims that have already been settled. </p><p class="a">I think that the argument that Māori are just as good as anyone else to stand for election has some validity. I think that we are, in fact, as Māori, just as good as our fellow citizens, and we should be putting ourselves forward to stand for those positions. However, that raises another issue, and I am not quite sure whether, ultimately, it will lead to another claim against the Crown—that people have been denied the opportunity of having their own wards so that they can stand for council. This bill does meet the intention of both the iwi and the Crown, and, on behalf of New Zealand First, we commend this bill to the House.</p></div></body>

I acknowledge you as well, Nuk Kōrako, who conducts the affairs of the Māori Affairs Committee; well done. I say "Morning" to us, my fellow work colleagues, and pay a tribute to you of Ngāruahine seated above; my pillars, my greatness, and you who are supporting this matter, well done. You are the ones pursuing this matter and, yes, not only in the past 20 and 30 years but further back to the time when the land was confiscated. Your family and ancestors fought it, the land was the reason. And so I commend you for coming here to the second reading of the Hineuru bill. This morning I want to read this one of the accounts. It was written by Ron Hudson and is in the deed of settlement.</em> </p><p class="a"><em>The substance of this account is in his words, and so I proceed to read it. Ngāruahinerangi emerged from the great heavens standing here before us, Rangitūhāhā and Māreikura. From Māreikura came Terangiwhakataka, Taumakumaku of the heavens, Te Paraparawai of the heavens, Te Māriahou of the heavens, Te Matawaiwai, Te Tuarā of the heavens, Te Matauarā of the heavens, Te Takinui of the heavens, Tūtewanawana of the heavens, Aoaoariki of the heavens, Kirikiri-ō-Mātangi, Te Toi of the heavens, and thus the dominant tribe of Taranaki at large of Ngāruahinerang; indeed oh! "Peace on earth and goodwill to all mankind!" </em></p><p class="a"><em>In the year 1863 when the plundering and confiscation began, the soldiers with their guns and cannons came from the direction of the river of Waitōtara. When the confiscation and plundering began at that time, we had ownership of our mountain, river, land, forest, seashore, oil, carvings, our Māoritanga, courtyards, gardens, homes, and burial places, and, ultimately, some of them died as a consequence of the confiscation, and all the land was wiped out. There then is the substance of this account. It is in the account by this one of the leaders. My eye sight is ageing somewhat, and that is the reason why I was unable to read it. But so much for that; I do want to acknowledge you collectively.</em>]</p><p class="a">Ngāruahine, in the Waitangi Tribunal report, said this: "They could be the largest in the country. There may be no others where as many Treaty breaches had equivalent force and effect over a comparable time." We have heard today of the debate that has raged during this settlement, but it goes back to the heart of this. There was a Treaty signed in this country, of partnership. The member here, Pita Paraone, has just said that there was some debate as to whether or not there should be seats in a governance responsibility on regional council and council positions, but partnership is just that—where two partners come together. The report itself highlights the breaches equivalent to none other: "[The] Treaty breaches had equivalent force and effect over a comparable time. We see the claims of standing on two major foundations, land deprivation and disempowerment, with the latter being the main. By 'disempowerment', we mean the denigration and destruction of Maori autonomy or self-government." In the whai kōrero that I just read out from the deed of settlement, that is the heart of the matter: the loss of mana, of power, of autonomy, and of rangatiratanga.</p><p class="a">"Generous reparation policies are needed to remove the prejudice to Maori, to restore the honour of the Government,"—if it can be restored—"to ensure cultural survival, and to re-establish effective interaction between the Treaty partners." Well, effective interaction, in my mind, would mean co-governance arrangements over areas of environment and over the interests of the people in that area. "Ngāruahine record the following Tribunal findings: the whole history of Government dealings with Maori in Taranaki were the antithesis to that envisaged by the Treaty … the war in south Taranaki was commenced by the Crown without just cause and was contrary to the Treaty of Waitangi", and why was it commenced? For no other reason but to secure land for settlement. </p><p class="a">And why did the Government forces come out on the people of Ngāruahine? Because they simply refused to sell. Confiscation removed Ngāruahine's land entirely. The Government's purchase of the land offered inadequate protection of Māori interests and "did not meet the required standards of sincerity, justice and good faith to be valid in terms of the Treaty;". And, finally, "the imprisonments without trial of several hundred Maori was contrary to the Treaty of Waitangi." </p><p class="a">Despite all of the conversations and the debates and the submissions that we have heard, there is one thing that is clear: no matter what settlement redress Ngāruahine is able to be afforded through this process, it will in no way make up for the huge injustice. It is merely a beginning. It must be acknowledged, as it has been for many other Treaty settlements, that this is, in fact, the largest koha, or show of generosity, from one people to another, to accept such a minimal amount in order to redress the utter destruction meted out against the people of Ngāruahine and, indeed, the iwi in other Treaty settlements across the country. </p><p class="a">We have heard about the conflict with Āraukuku, and I recognise that Ngāruahine, in the submissions that we heard, were very supportive of Āraukuku's claim, so we recognise that. It was a matter of great debate amongst us in the Māori Affairs Committee. We wanted to ensure that everybody had their day to present their issues in front of the Tribunal and we recognised that Āraukuku had not been afforded that opportunity, so now that has gone on to another court to see whether there can be a way forward. </p><p class="a">But we are here today for the second reading. We have heard the redress and the packages that are going to be offered. We have heard the apology that has come from the Crown, and although that in no way makes up for the injustices that have been meted out upon the people of Ngāruahine, it is, again, in their generosity that they come to this point and accept this settlement offer so that they can progress and so that they can move forward and start to put behind them the injustices so that they can build an enduring relationship with the Crown to progress forward, and that also means their local government—their establishment of places on council—so that they can have a stronger part to play, and say, in the dealings of their people in the settlement where they live. No reira e te iwi, nei te mihi atu ki a koutou, tēnā koutou, kia ora mai tātau katoa. [<em>Therefore people, I acknowledge you collectively. Well done; my appreciation to us all</em>]</p></div></body>

That is enough for the House; I rise to endorse the contributions that flowed without restraint in our House today. I also support the tributes bestowed upon you the relative of Pōmare, of Ngāti Manu, and my senior kin, Kelvin. You made our day by saying a prayer to unite us spiritually under the considerations and protection of our Creator. Enough.</em></p><p class="a"><em>I endorse the tributes to the myriad of our deaths, brought here before us today by our House. I truly endorse that</em><em>,</em><em> saying to them: "Come forth, depart." You, and indeed all of us collectively, have alluded to my own ones, namely Sir Graham and Charlie Pētera, including those within Mōtatau in the last few days—and that is Rob Cooper. This House must not delude itself that Rob worked tirelessly for Ngāti Hine, with Ngāpuhi being the cause—not at all! His role was to organise Māori health services throughout the country. Therefore, I too share the tears expended, the grief and laments to that incredible person from within me of Ngāti Hine; and so, the fatherly figure, Rob, depart, go forth, farewell.</em></p><p class="a"><em>I therefore bring the focus of the discourse back to us</em><em>,</em><em> the House, </em><em>and </em><em>my acknowledgments to us all. I endorse the salutations accorded to you collectively. You have returned here once again into the Lair of the Lions, to listen to the substance of this bill. It is not for us to say to you these comments are ours—absolutely not at all! But the considerations by the Māori Affairs Committee have ended. They have sat among you to listen carefully to all the discourse about this bill. And so I personally acknowledge you collectively, come hither, welcome back, welcome. </em></p><p class="a"><em>I acknowledge the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations and his profound speculation in his speech today that by the end of this year Taranaki's western tribes will be united. So allow us and you collectively, to celebrate the </em><em>work</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em> you and the Minister's office have done to resolve the claims which came out of the matters relating to the Treaty of Waitangi. I commend that profound viewpoint because we Māori people know full well that this genealogical thing cannot be dismantled. If the commentary that emerged relating to this bill was examined carefully, all subtribes were talking about the parts in the bill; this thing is not about unravelling you collectively—far from it! It is actually saying it is about subtribes, therefore it is about the mandate. All subtribes are focusing on key tribal issues throughout the nation. Therefore this thing—genealogy—should not be left for the law to unravel, dismantle, and cut up; we of Māoridom will be driven apart! But I do congratulate you my esteemed ones of Ngāruahine, and the many subtribes in your midst.</em></p><p class="a"><em>This House has spoken about the people who came before the Māori Affairs Committee and one such was Āruakuku.

Enough, I commend these words.</em></p><p class="a"><em>In my time here in this House, Parliament House, I have observed a huge number of Treaty claims that have come in and have gone out. However, the concerns and unease of Māoridom are still there. My elder kinsman, Pita Paraone, has spoken to me about this kind of situation. He told me: despite the hard-headed attitude of the Government, you must hold fast to Ngāpuhi's table. We are saying that the subtribes have the mandate. Subtribes have executive control on many marae. Subtribes have the languages and the talk </em><em>of</em><em> the people. So what I am advocating here as I read the accounts about subtribes, is that you must be resolute—despite this Government's arrangements, regardless what others may come up with in terms of strategies, or </em><em>dismantling genealogy by this Government to split you in your way of life on your land. I note the comments in this</em><em> bill</em><em>, saying</em><em>—</em>]</p><p class="a"> "The Crown has made it clear that the nature of Āraukuku's alignment with the two iwi, Ngāti Ruanui and Ngāruahine, in Treaty settlements was for the hapū and the two iwi to resolve."</p><p class="a">Nā tēnā, e mihi atu ana au ki tērā whakaaro rangatira.

That is for you to determine—do not leave it for the law to split us in two. Enough said!</em></p><p class="a"><em>I continue to acknowledge the speakers and their contributions in regard to this bill. These kinds of sentiments have been brought to bear by the House. I reflect upon the genesis and the history of this matter. That, indeed, is the reason why you have arrived here collectively today. It is saying that the historical accounts talk about confiscation, theft of land, </em><em>and </em><em>imprisonment of your very own ancestors, but I think about your circumstances over the years from that period right down to now, OK? Should those matters be </em><em>critically discerned? T</em><em>he</em><em>se</em><em> matters relate to the law and how you live on your lands, from that time right down to this moment. Some are saying this thing is called "systematic legislation", OK? That indeed is the way procedures move. In my view, modern day acts of confiscation violate and taunt you, Ngāruahine, from the time the land was confiscated right down to now.</em></p><p class="a"><em>When I look at this bill and i</em><em>ts</em><em> </em><em>three parts </em><em>to see if your grievances and your matters relating to the Treaty of Waitangi can be settled, in this bill it can be settled—yes, indeed. And so, further to that and at this present moment, I am familiar with the procedures of this House. The third reading of this bill will conclude presently. I go back again to the plea from the Minister to you: that you remain united in your happiness, glorification, and fulfilment in regards to claim matters, collective recognition, acknowledgment, and settlement of claims by the coming October. That is, indeed, an inspirational thought. Enough of that, my esteemed ones, I am endorsing this bill in its second reading. Enough—you heard the bell ring, my esteemed ones—congratulations, well done, and my appreciation to us all.</em>]</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160629 10:15:36" ></a><strong>JOANNE HAYES (National)</strong>: Kia ora e te whānau whānui o Ngāruahine, rau rangatira mā hoki, ā, tēnā koutou, nau mai, haere mai ki te rā whakahirahira i tēnei rangi. [<em>Acknowledgments to you, the extended family of Ngāruahine, and also to the esteemed ones of a hundredfold. Salutations, welcome, and draw hither on this day of high importance today.</em>] I am pleased to stand to support this bill today in its second reading. But before I do that, I want to acknowledge the passing of Tā Graham Latimer, who had a major impact on the whole of the motu for the many amazing deeds that he did. I also want to pay tribute to Charlie Petera, another kaumātua rangatira from Tai Tokerau, and, finally, to Rob Cooper from Ngāti Hine. I want to especially mention Rob Cooper because he had a big impact on hauora Māori for Aotearoa New Zealand and he would have had a big impact up there in Ngāruahine. I started working within the health sector when I first came across Rob Cooper and Gwen Tepānia-Palmer. I was amazed at the amount of work and the push that they had in driving the improvement of Māori health through the implementation of the Māori health providers throughout the motu. That is why I just wanted to take some time out to acknowledge Rob Cooper.</p><p class="a">Ngāruahine is one of eight Taranaki iwi who have been through this process or are coming through this process now and in the future. It is amazing that our select committee and the Crown can actually bring together all of these claims from Taranaki through this House during this year. It is amazing because all of the eight iwi have their roots to the Maunga, Taranaki, and the horrific injustices that happened there and throughout that area of Taranaki.</p><p class="a">I want to acknowledge the many people who came to the select committee hearing in Hāwera this year. I want to acknowledge them because it is really, really difficult to articulate a lifetime of injustices in 10 minutes to a group of MPs who are sitting there listening intently, putting together the parts to your puzzle and to your history. I want to acknowledge you, because to do that takes a lot of guts and a lot of nerve, a lot of talking with your whānau and bringing together the words that you need to say so we can actually hear all the stories. I want to acknowledge you; it is not an easy thing to do. Actually, I have never submitted to a select committee, so I take my hat off to you.</p><p class="a">I want to also acknowledge our Minister, the Hon Christopher Finlayson. I do that quite often here, but I just want to acknowledge him because he sweats a lot for all the claims. He does that and works really hard. I have been privileged to be part and parcel of the many signings that he has done throughout the country, and the words that he articulates in the speeches and apologies come from the heart. I have seen him on one particular occasion where a teardrop nearly got there and he was able to hold it together, but that is how passionate he is. I think that many people in the country do not realise the blood, sweat, and tears that he goes through to actually make sure that iwi are acknowledged by the Crown.</p><p class="a">Some people might say "Oh, it is not enough.", and others might say "It is too much.", but I say it is the start. It is either the start of your economic development for the growth of your iwi or it is to grow what you have already put in place. All of these claims here, they are not about the people sitting in the gallery. They are about the future. They are about the mokopuna who come through. You know, it is about everything that is going to happen into the future. And all of you sitting here today, in this House, you will go down in the history—your history—as your mokopuna, in years to come, will look back and say: "It was my koro, my kuia who sat there and pushed hard for that day to happen." So I have no other things to say today, in the second reading. I am very privileged and proud to commend the bill to the House. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

Ā, tēnei anō e mihi atu ki a koutou Ngāruahine, ki Matua Te Tapu, te maunga Taranaki, ki a koutou kua tae mai nei i tēnei wā; tēnā koutou. Kia kaua e pōhēhē koutou ko tēnei te tutukitanga mō Āraukuku, ēngari e tika ana, me kōrero tātou ki tēnei take. Ā, waihotia mō te pānui tuatoru ki te whakawhānui ake i ngā whakaaro mā koutou ēngari, e pā ana ki te momo o ngā kaupapa i puta mai i mua i te aroaro o Te Komiti Māori, ka tika, ka whakamārama pai kia waiho ki konei. Ka mutu te wāhanga o te tutukitanga ki te pānui tuatoru.</p><p class="a">[<em>I link my thoughts to the Almighty Above and to the prayer that readied us for today. I acknowledge you once again, Ngāruahine, and Matua Te Tapu, which is Mount Taranaki to you who have arrived here at this point in time; welcome. You must not think mistakenly that this is the final settlement in regard to Āraukuku, but it is appropriate that this matter is discussed by us. Leave the elaboration of viewpoints for your consideration at the third reading, but in terms of the kinds of proposals that emerged before the Māori Affairs Committee, it is right that they are explained well and left here. The part relating to the settlement will reach a conclusion at the third reading.</em>]</p><p class="a">I just want to offer some comments with regard to the substantive issues considered by the Māori Affairs Committee, and raised through the submission process. This is a second reading, so it is important for us to ensure that all the matters that were considered and traversed by the committee are clarified here so that by the time we get to the third reading and the substantive matters of the Ngāruahine settlement we are able to move forward confidently and in a way that gives Ngāruahine a level of assurance that it is an opportunity for the iwi to move forward.</p><p class="a">Kei whea te rongoa mō tēnei tūāhuatanga, te muru, te raupatu i pā mai ki runga i a koutou, i a mātou; te tangohia o ō tātou nei whenua nā te ture i mahia, nā te pakanga i mahia, taua tūāhuatanga hei patu i a tātou whakapapa? Ā, kua puta mai aua kōrero katoa.</p><p class="a">[<em>Where is the remedy for these kinds of situations—plundering, confiscation—that you and we experienced; where these lands of ours were taken possession of, and that the law and warfare effected, and whereby those situations subdued our genealogy? All those sentiments emerged.</em>]</p><p class="a">So it is a very difficult situation, in terms of trying to traverse some of the historical realities of what happened, and reconciling some of those through a Treaty settlement process. My colleagues before me have spoken at length on that. But can I say, at the select committee level, when the submitters came to the committee—albeit with some specific issues of contention with where interests were best represented—ultimately, the committee did not get a strong sense that this was about a contest between iwi or between hapū; actually, this was a frustration with regard to the Crown process. So I acknowledge that in the first instance.</p><p class="a">In the second instance—and I happened to be the local MP when the Ngāti Ruanui settlement was reached. Let me just, for the purposes of those listening to this debate, consider the Āraukuku matter within that context. Members of the select committee had heard that the Ngāti Ruanui settlement had substantially addressed Āraukuku interests. They had been recognised in terms of having a seat on the governance board, and they were included in the claimant definition. However, the matter that came to the select committee under the Ngāruahine settlement was that the Wai 552 claim was not extinguished. So your common-sense approach would say: "Well, if Āraukuku's interests were settled under the Ruanui settlement, why wasn't the Waitangi Tribunal claim extinguished at that point if the Crown was so confident?". We pursued all those types of questions to try to understand the submissions coming to us under the Ngāruahine settlement. </p><p class="a">With that said, I think, in my mind, what it whittled down to was that there were some interests that may have been thought to be outside the Ruanui settlement that may have been addressed in the Ngāruahine settlement. Even if I whittle it down further, the matter really could be condensed down to the power station, which is why the select committee made comment on it. Minister, the way in which you referred to the Stratford Power Station land and its inability to be utilised for settlement purposes while recognising that that is an issue that remains outstanding is helpful, I think, as people try to ensure that the nature and extent of their interests in specific areas that have not been addressed by either settlement can still be recognised. That is really important because Āraukuku did say quite clearly that the extinguishment of their Wai claim within the context of the Ruanui settlement was something that they did not consent to. However, this committee did not change that—it did not take that out. It recognised that this bill will continue with the Wai claim, Wai 552, and the recognition that it will be extinguished.</p><p class="a">A couple of other matters that the committee concerned itself with as a result of the Āraukuku submission were mainly that in clause 13 of the bill there was no specific reference to Āraukuku, and the issue was around the whakapapa connection. It was a really difficult situation on our select committee—we were not there to arbitrate over whakapapa. We would much rather prefer that those matters had been dealt with well before the bill came to our committee. However, we understood that these were matters that were so inextricably linked to your connection to the whenua that they would undoubtedly come to the committee. So when we were informed that Āraukuku's connection to Ngāruahine was through Kānihi-Umutahi and Ōkahu-Inuawai hapū, we could only but accept that that was the case. Even though we heard that the Ketemarae Pā was outside the interests affected by the Ngāruahine settlement, we understood that to the extent of the Ngāruahine settlement there was an opportunity for Āraukuku interests to connect back here. </p><p class="a">Imperfect as it is for Āraukuku—and we tried very hard—you will see in much of the select committee's report that we tried very hard to try to whittle through every issue that was raised. Imperfect as these explanations may be, for Āraukuku the committee resolved that, actually, there was very little we could do other than recognise the extent of their representation to our committee and the importance of ensuring that for the public record there potentially may remain matters unresolved. But the relationships with Ngāti Ruanui and Ngāruahine for the time being are absolutely critical to enable Āraukuku to move forward and also to enable Ngāruahine and Ngāti Ruanui to continue to move forward. Can I just reiterate to the House, so that there is no misunderstanding, there was not a high level of animosity between Ngāruahine and Āraukuku—there was not. It was very much a frustration with the process.</p><p class="a">Minister, you have heard all the contributions from the committee at this second reading of the bill. Can I just, for your benefit, acknowledge the extent to which the officials went to the degree of giving us the advice that we needed to make a confident decision in the report that we are providing here today. Can I thank my colleague Adrian Rurawhe, for sitting on this committee. As was mentioned by our chair, Nuk Korako, he offered sage advice to us and a level of wisdom that was helpful to the committee. Nō reira, tēnei te tino mihi atu ki a koe, Adrian, mō tērā, tō mahi, āe, i Te Rohe o Te Taihauāuru.</p><p class="a">[<em>And so I really acknowledge you, Adrian, for that, in terms of your work in the Western region.</em>]</p><p class="a">Lastly, in terms of the technical amendments and the transfer of responsibilities for the post-settlement governance entity and just making sure that no liabilities will transfer, we saw that as a very worthy amendment and we are happy to recommend it to the House on the third reading. Ka waihotia te whakawhānui ake o ngā painga katoa mō te tutukitanga o Ngāruahine ki taua wā ēngari mō tēnei wā, anei he pitopito kōrero, he paku whakamārama mō ngā āhuatanga i tae mai i mua i te aroaro o te komiti. Ka nui te mihi atu ki a koutou, kia tātou katoa, tēnā koe.  </p><p class="a">[<em>To t</em><em>he actual elaboration</em><em>s of all benefits relating to the settlement of Ngāruahine—to that moment—but for now, here are some little bits of information and explanations in regard to the situations that came before the committee. I have much admiration for you collectively and for us all; so thank you.</em>]</p></div></body>

As a Pākehā member of Parliament from the Waikato region, I am a little bit too far removed from the action to be able to speak in great detail about this particular bill, but this is a very significant occasion.

Their futures are being shaped by the decisions that are being made. </p><p class="a">So it is my fervent prayer that this will have a very positive outcome for the iwi. I am absolutely confident that it is having a very positive atmosphere and result for our country as a whole. It is bringing to us a much greater degree of understanding. It is right that we correct the wrongs of the past, and that we learn from those lessons.

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="BillDebate"><strong>HINEURU CLAIMS SETTLEMENT BILL</strong></p><p class="SubDebate"><strong>Third Reading</strong></p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20160629 10:32:29" ></a><strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON (Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations)</strong>: I move , <em>That the Hineuru Claims Settlement Bill be now read a third time</em>. I want to begin by welcoming the community of Hineuru here today. It is fitting that we are in this House, where matters of law are discussed, to address the wrongs that have been committed by the Crown against the people of Hineuru. I recognise a number of visitors in the gallery today. They will never have entered this House before, and many will have a relationship with the institution of this building that is clouded by a long history of mistrust and grievance. I hope their experience today is going to be a positive one. </p><p class="a">Hineuru's journey to settlement stretches back decades. While I acknowledge those present, it is only right to mention those who are no longer with us—the original claimants, who carried the claims of their tīpuna but were unable to see their aspirations recognised in legislation. I pay tribute to those who were instrumental in reaching this day, including Hine Campbell, Rere Puna, Kori Hill, Nick Wall, Emi Wall, Puāwai Rāhui, Hoani Hōhepa, and Whetū Tipiwai. I also want to mention Nicholas Twohill. He was a former historian from the Office of Treaty Settlements whose final work before he passed away was directed at describing the injustice suffered by this people—injustices that have put a serious stain on the reputation of the Crown and need to be recorded in <em>Hansard</em> today as a reminder to future generations of the hurt borne by past generations of Hineuru. </p><p class="a">The tīpuna of Hineuru lived and cultivated land in the mountainous inland region between Napier and Taupō Moana. This was a strategically important area because it was one of the main thoroughfares between the central North Island and the Hawke's Bay. Unfortunately, their first interactions with the Crown took the form of protests at the Crown's failure to include Hineuru in its negotiations to purchase the Ahuriri block. In October 1866 Crown forces attacked a group of Māori who were camped at Ōmarunui, near Napier, after the expiry of an unreasonable ultimatum calling on the group to surrender. On the same day Crown forces intercepted, surrounded, and subsequently attacked another group, led by Hineuru rangatira Te Rangihīroa, further north near Pētane. Crown forces killed him and also other Hineuru people during the attacks, and then pursued Hineuru and other Māori into their rohe and plundered their kāinga. </p><p class="a">Thirty-four members of Hineuru were captured, and were among the 86 prisoners who were transported to the Chatham Islands without trial. While these prisoners were being held captive the Crown proclaimed a large confiscation district in the Hawke's Bay that included a great deal of Hineuru land. After years of protest by members of Hineuru, the Crown in 1924 promoted legislation that allowed the Native Land Court to award land in Tarawera and Tataraakina to Hineuru individuals descended from those who had been excluded from the 1870 grants. However, this action was repudiated by the Crown in 1952, when it promoted legislation that overturned these titles. For Hineuru, these actions resulted in decades of uncertainty about tenure, significant financial costs, and social and cultural dislocation, and left them virtually landless. Yet, despite all this, they have persevered. </p><p class="a">I ask all members to stop for a moment and consider this—to consider how a people could go from a position of holding a fertile area of strategic importance to one in which they were left virtually landless, alienated from their traditional homes, and struggling to maintain leadership structures, cultural practices, and, indeed, their very language. I ask members to consider how the people of Hineuru sitting in the gallery today, whose ancestors have been subjected to such horrific treatment, and who have suffered economic and social marginalisation in their own rohe, can find it within themselves to be able to sit at the same table and engage in this process of reconciliation with the very group who, despite being entrusted to protect their interests, were responsible for the loss that was suffered. </p><p class="a">It is a testament to the character of this people that we are here today. It is a testament to their generosity, to their desire for a better future for their children, that they have forgone full compensation for the losses they have suffered. By accepting this settlement, the people of Hineuru give a great deal to their country, and for this I thank them. </p><p class="a">I want to acknowledge the Hineuru negotiation team. I want to make a particular reference to Karauna Brown and Ivy Kahukiwa-Smith for their significant contribution as lead negotiators. I want to acknowledge the other trustees of their trust, including Tirohia Bridger, Rēnata Bush, Toi Tāwhai, Te Reo Spooner, and Tūhuiao Kahukiwa. All these individuals have carried the heavy weight of their tūpuna and deserve praise for their services. Can I also acknowledge their advisers, including Traci Houpapa and the team from Kensington Swan, who have made a significant contribution to pursuing this settlement. Finally, I want to thank the Crown team, ably led by one of our own, Paul Swain. Although this is undoubtedly a day for the Hineuru community, I know that officials from across various departments share their excitement. </p><p class="a">At the deed's signing, I spoke about the significance of rangatahi—those who will inherit the full benefits of this settlement—who will not be made to endure the same prejudices as their tīpuna and who, I hope, will remember their history and will share it with generations to come. I reiterate these comments in this third reading speech but say something more: the time has now come for you to persist and persevere. The weight of your tīpuna will now fall on your own shoulders to carry, and through this settlement I hope your shoulders will not be overburdened. </p><p class="a">I want to finish by recalling the first negotiations meeting, when the negotiators presented Crown officials with an old New Zealand flag. This was the last flag flown at the Te Hāroto School, and it flew at their marae on the day the officials met with Hineuru. In the past the flag had been flown as a symbol of partnership with the Crown. During the meeting the negotiators said they have lost faith as a result of preparing their claims for negotiation. They lowered the flag, they folded it, and they presented it to the Crown with a challenge to the Crown to hold it until such time as Hineuru considered the relationship of trust and good faith had been restored. I have the flag today and look forward to presenting it to the people of Hineuru after this bill has been passed. I look forward to the flag flying again in Te Hāroto as a representation of the partnership and of mutual trust between the parties. It has been a long journey, and I am delighted that we have reached this stage. I commend the bill to the House.</p></div></body>

I empathise with the family and mention these ones as well here: Uncle Robin, Ngātoru, Ngahere, and Janice. And so welcome, welcome to the House of Parliament here today in regards to the matter. Thank you.</em>]</p><p class="a">Kia ora to Kahukiwa as chair of Ngāti Hineuru Iwi Inc., and all of our whānau. Today is a special day. Today the Hineuru Claims Settlement Bill will be passed into law in this Parliament. I am incredibly proud to stand here as Ngāti Hineuru representing our whānau in this Parliament on this incredibly significant day.</p><p class="a">Ko Tītī-ō-Kura Te Maunga, ko Mōhaka Te Awa, ko Te Rangihīroa Te Tangata, ko Ngāti Hineuru Te Iwi.</p><p class="a">[<em>Tītī-ō-Kura is the mountain, Mōhaka is the river, Te Rangihīroa is the man, and Ngāti Hineuru is the tribe.</em>] </p><p class="a">Hineuru, daughter of Tukuha, descendent of Apa Hāpaitaketake—our rohe within the following rivers: Ripia, connecting with the Mōhaka, to Te Hoe, to Hautapu, to Te Pukahunui Stream, to Matakuhia Stream, to Waipunga River, to the Ōkoeke Stream, to the Tunamārō Stream, back to the Ripia. Our rohe within the following whenua blocks: Mōhaka, Waikare Blocks, Pukahunui, Rūnanga, Pohukura, Heruiwi, Whirinaki and the Kaingaroa. Ngāti Hineuru has links with Ngāti Apa, Ngāti Manawa, Ngāti Whare, Ngāti Tūwharetoa, and Tūhoe. Our ancestors, including Kura, snared tītī at night by raising a net in the air and building a bonfire behind it. The birds attracted by the light would be snared by the net—hence Tītīōkura.</p><p class="a">So why are we here today, whānau? What happened to Ngāti Hineuru? According to the Waitangi Tribunal, commenting on the 1851 Ahuriri purchase: "It is also doubtful whether all parties with rights in the land were consulted, fully understood, and agreed to the transaction. For example, insufficient effort was made to obtain Ngāti Hineuru's agreement. Instead, their consent was essentially acquired ex post facto, when the transaction was a fait accompli." </p><p class="a">Between 1863 and 1870 Ngāti Hineuru were victims of Crown raupatu. We suffered armed invasion, military attack, destruction of our property. We were exiled to Wharekauri—the Chatham Islands—and some of our whānau were executed. The Crown were the thieves, the Crown were the murderers. Samuel Locke, resident magistrate in Taupō, had come to believe by February 1869 that Ngāti Hineuru "was practically extinct", with most of our lands confiscated.</p><p class="a">I would like to read through what happened in terms of our history. The pretext for the confiscation was the so-called battle of Ōmarunui in 1866, when a group of Pai Mārire supporters encamped at Ōmarunui was attacked by Crown forces. Some of those at Ōmarunui were Ngāti Hineuru. Te Rangi Hīroa, Hineuru's principal chief, was killed at Pētane on the same day. </p><p class="a">Following the battle of Ōmarunui, survivors of the battle were transported to Wharekauri. The Ōmarunui detainees had not been given any kind of trial, whether civil or military—a process that the Waitangi Tribunal has found to be illegal. In its <em>Mohaka ki Ahuiri Report</em> the Waitangi Tribunal found that "The manner in which 'confessions' were extracted after Omarunui and the prisoners' indefinite detention on the Chathams without trial amount to breaches by the Crown of its duty of active protection and its duty to act reasonably and in good faith." Subsequently many Ngāti Hineuru people were with Te Kooti's Whakarau when he led the escape from the Chathams, and from 1868 until 1872, Te Kooti's fate and that of Ngāti Hineuru were intertwined. </p><p class="a">The Waitangi Tribunal analysed the events at Ngātapa at length in its Tūranga report. In this, the context of the concession by the Crown was that unarmed prisoners at Ngātapa were executed by agents by the State and that this was a breach of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Executed was Ngāti Hineuru leader Nīkora Te Whakaunua. </p><p class="a">I looked at the history of Ngātapa in preparing for this third reading speech, and I will just quote from this source: "… somewhere between 86 and 128 people, captured or surrendered at the end of [the] siege, [were] stripped naked, lined up against the side of a cliff, and … executed without trial by government forces." One of the attendees that day, a J P Ward, who was a member of the armed constabulary, wrote: "In all some 130 odd of the defenders of Ngatapa were captured in the bush and gorges below the pa where they lay asleep having had neither sleep nor water for 2 days. They were marched up the hill side again under the outer wall—as it were—of the pa they had defended so long and so heroically, stripped of every vestige of clothing they possessed and SHOT—shot like dogs. There was no mention of a trial or if any or all of them had participated in the [Poverty Bay, Matawhero] Massacre. That did not matter to us one straw. They were shot and their bodies left to swelter and rot under the summer's sun and bones to bleach to this day. And all this—and very much more—as done beneath the … flag of mighty England." </p><p class="a">We do not know our history. New Zealanders do not know their history. What the Treaty settlement process enables is for us to reclaim our history. Ngāti Hineuru has committed to six pou of their settlement. The first is the "Restoration and protection of our cultural heritage and history for future generations." Our tamariki need to know our stories, and through this Treaty settlement process, through pieces of legislation such as this, our whānau will never forget. So there is an opportunity for us to commemorate our history through education, through language, and through culture. </p><p class="a">Ngāti Hineuru have also committed to the "Restoration of the health and wellbeing of our people.", and one of the main priorities is to ensure that our whānau have housing and that we create health centres. There is a "Recognition of the mana of Ngati Hineuru and restoration of the relativity Ngati Hineuru had with other iwi of the region." The primary focus from Ngāti Hineuru will be on our relationships with our fellow iwi, but also with our local and central government representatives. There will be a "Reassertion of the presence of Ngati Hineuru through our rohe". There will be information boards and names that are relevant to our whakapapa. We will rebuild "an economic base for Ngati Hineuru.", and there will also be "Revitalisation and restoration of our role as kaitiaki of our resources and environment.", an implicit commitment to the revitalisation of our fisheries and birdlife. </p><p class="a">I have read the latest <em>Te Kokonga Kōrero</em>, and our whānau are committing to Hineuru scholarships. One of our main focuses will be on ensuring that our tamariki have the best access to education. There is also an emphasis on our trustee elections. We are trying to get as many of the whānau as possible involved in the post-settlement entity. In their <em>Te Kokonga Kōrero</em> is their strategic vision: "Hineuru—ka tupu, ka ora, ka rea; Hineuru, we grow, we thrive and we prosper." </p><p class="a">It is my absolute pleasure to speak on behalf of Ngāti Hineuru in the House today and to commend this piece of legislation to the House. Thank you.</p></div></body>

Hineuru the tenacious, strongminded, and brave; greetings, welcome and come forth into Parliament House. Welcome to the groans, the contributions and the grieving being shed here. I therefore welcome you, the adults, the tribe, welcome, welcome, welcome!</em> </p><p class="a"><em>I have heard the contributions and will not be revisiting the statements made by the Minister. He has outlined the history and all that relate to you collectively, but I heard my sister colleagues' sob and, hey, my recollections go back to her uncle John Wall, but at the same time to Emmy and Whetū, to those ones whom I knew in their time. I heard her heart rending sob! This came from within her, a situation that wells up within us all Māori here!</em></p><p class="a"><em>It is not a new one, because this is the situation, with claims every time the seat of emotions is chewed at, the heart laments, and so I commend the tenor of your contribution sister colleague. It is quite nice but sad also to hear as a consequence of the bite of the burdens placed upon Ngāti Hineuru, but at the same because of your massive number here this very day. </em></p><p class="a"><em>This is the final reading, and, yes, it is apt for tears to be shed! Therefore, I will not revisit those stories, my esteemed ones. This is but a short address to simply advise that the Māori Party support all these accounts and the real desire for it to move forward. Yes, there is a place for history, but the benefit is there in the people seated here. Their job is to report the contributions so that they remain here in this Parliament House for the many days ahead in the future. </em></p><p class="a"><em>A time will come, perhaps, in the future when the grandchildren will be able to say to us: Where are the contributions that were delivered on this very day 40 years ago, before us! Just like us of this generation, we are able to go back to the accounts delivered by Apirana Ngata in their time. So this is the advantage of delivering speeches in Parliament House and reported, eventually; they remain here and are recorded forever. </em></p><p class="a"><em>The real purpose of my contribution was to talk about the situation in the future, and not about the difficulties that have emerged, as it will totally prolong discussions. Therefore, I do commend you and your perseverance. Despite the difficulties that affected you, you remained successful and confident. Despite the pressures that were referred to, your focus has remained fixed on making it to the top and being independent in the contributions and histories, and that you are able to participate; you are not a subtribe but a tribe in reality. Furthermore, you have your own needs and aspirations. Therefore, my address must remain focused on that one of the contributions.</em>] </p><p class="a">This is just to congratulate Ngāti Hineuru on being here today, although I hear the tangi of my sister Louisa Wall over there and, of course, of all of the iwi. For the recording of the history it is great that we have <em>Hansard</em> here so that it can always act as a record for the future, and the generations to come will find a space to come back here and be able to look at the discussion that happened today in the third part of this third reading of the bill. Hopefully it will become law in a very short space of time. </p><p class="a">I have not gone back to the past history, because it has been hugely covered by both of the previous speakers—by the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations himself, and also by my colleague Louisa Wall. As I have said, these are not good times to be a Māori in Parliament discussing these issues. It happens every time that you cannot but feel an element of sadness, and yet huge respect for what our people tried to do in the face of huge provocation. The destruction of papakāinga, the loss of land—that sort of stuff is pretty hard to get over. </p><p class="a">But I suppose today is about looking to the future, and if I can, in this short period of time—because I do not wish to go back over stuff that has already been mentioned—I will share with the House today a small excerpt from the <em>Hineuru Strategic Plan 2016-2020</em>, "Hineuru 2040—a dream for the future"<em>.</em> In that document it says: "Our people stand proud but humble in knowing who they are and their own individual whakapapa. … We have CEO's from across many sectors from land management, business and new technologies always being asked to go and support other iwi and other peoples around the world … Our people are healthier and our kaumatua are livelier because they don't suffer from many illnesses. This is due to an increased quality of housing for our people. Our whanau are living longer and our tamariki mokopuna are not influenced by drugs and other aspects." Mēnā koinei te whāinga matua o tēnei iwi, me mihi rā ki tērā āhuatanga! [<em>If</em><em> </em><em>this</em><em> </em><em>indeed</em><em> </em><em>is</em><em> the </em><em>primary</em><em> </em><em>aim</em><em> of </em><em>this</em><em> </em><em>tribe</em><em>, </em><em>then</em><em> </em><em>they</em><em> </em><em>must</em><em> </em><em>be</em><em> </em><em>applauded</em><em> for </em><em>that</em><em>!</em>]</p><p class="a">As I travelled many times between Taupō, where I used to live, and Napier/Ahuriri, I went directly through the heartland of Ngāti Hineuru. You get to the top of the hill at Te Hāroto and you look around and you see the school and all the various papakāinga there. I just want to acknowledge the fact that, hopefully, this will set a pathway for Ngāti Hineuru into the future. This is the dream that they have set out for their people. </p><p class="a">Despite all the atrocities that they speak about, it is noteworthy that they are here today to talk, and, in particular, to pick up on the offer from the Minister to sit together and discuss that flag and what it might mean into the future. Most important, they bring with them values that I think are hugely important—the values of whakaiti, of manaakitanga, of kotahitanga, and of rangatiratanga, amongst many more. </p><p class="a">It is a privilege to be here today as the Minister for Māori Development and as a representative of the Māori Party to absolutely support this bill to be law and to allow Ngāti Hineuru to go where they want to go for their futures and for their mokopuna. </p><p class="a">Ā, ka nui taku mihi ki a koutou e hoa mā, whakaritea mai ai tā koutou mahere mō ngā rā kai mua i te aroaro, ka tupu, ka rea, arā, e kōrerohia ake nei.

Welcome to the Ngāti Hineuru's bill, to Parliament House, the Lions' Den. The lines are drawn, the dead to themselves and the living to ourselves. Greetings, acknowledgments and salutations to you collectively and to us all.</em>]</p><p class="a">It is a great honour for me to stand and speak in support of and endorse this bill, the Hineuru Claims Settlement Bill, at its third reading. I had the great honour—indeed, this was the last bill that I considered when I was a member of the Māori Affairs Committee. In my relatively short time in this House, in respect of the work that the Māori Affairs Committee has done, it is a great honour—that is all I can say, and I do acknowledge all the members who have participated in the great work that we do in that committee.</p><p class="a">Today is Ngāti Hineuru's day—Ngāti Hineuru, whom I would like to sum up as stamping their authority and indigeneity right across the motu today through the passage of this legislation. I guess that not too many folks would have heard of Ngāti Hineuru before, but after today and through the passage of this legislation, we know that Ngāti Hineuru are reasserting their rangatiratanga, and I am just so delighted by that. So often, when you consider the Hawke's Bay or go inland, Ngāti Hineuru have been overlooked, but that is no longer the case. I am just delighted to be able to share with the whānau who have travelled far and wide to come here on this special day, because these settlements are more than just acknowledging the historical wrongs and grievances that have taken place. As I have mentioned, these settlements are also about reasserting our history.</p><p class="a">That history, for us as Māori, is summed up in one word, and that is whakapapa. Our oral traditions and our whole genetic make-up come from those stories: the stories of the men and women, our ancestors, who created that history. They are stories of everyday life, wars, marriages, and death. They are all those strands that we hold so dear to our hearts, in memory of who we are and where we have come from. I do want to acknowledge my tuahine Louisa Wall, who gave a very eloquent speech outlining the terrible history and the terrible atrocities that have been inflicted upon Ngāti Hineuru. That is so appropriate, as she is a descendant herself, and I just acknowledge her for her whakaaro and such a moving speech.</p><p class="a">I do not wish to traverse the history, but I do note from this settlement certain names that have come out from other settlements that we have passed through this House and through the Māori Affairs Committee, of which I was a member. There are names of places such as Ōmarunui and Pētane, and the conflicts and battles that went on in those places—places like Ngātapa. These names have come up in the settlements with the Tūranga iwi, Rongawhakaata, Te Aitangi-a-Māhaki, and also with Maungaharuru-Tangitū. So not only are we reasserting the rangatiratanga of Ngāti Hineuru but also we are acknowledging the associations of the shared history that they and also other iwi have been impacted by.</p><p class="a">The atrocities were grave. We know about the systematic plunder, pursuit, and imprisonment of their tūpuna, and also the modus operandi of the Crown in terms of its purchasing and the fact that so much of Ngāti Hineuru's land was, effectively, given to other iwi. They had to suffer the indignity of being totally excluded and made virtually landless through the Crown's actions, so I do acknowledge all of the journey that Ngāti Hineuru has been on in order to arrive at this momentous day. It was a long journey, and we have heard many stories. I am inspired by the kōrero that Ngāti Hineuru Iwi Inc. and Te Kōpere gave to the committee and by how positive and how on to it they are in terms of their ushering in this new post-settlement era for Ngāti Hineuru.</p><p class="a">But if I can backtrack a bit, we have looked at the history of Ngāti Hineuru through this bill. I am the member for Te Tai Tonga. That is the largest electorate in the country, so I cover all of Wellington, all of Te Wai Pounamu, whiti atu, and over to Wharekauri, and so whenever I see the word "Wharekauri", my eyes choke up. I noted that—it is only one line in the bill; one line in the historical record—in 1866, I think, 34 Ngāti Hineuru were, with a total number of about 86, I think, taken as prisoners to Wharekauri, to the Chatham Islands, without trial. They were imprisoned in the harshest of conditions for over 2 years. One can only marvel—I mean, just wonder—at how those tūpuna endured all of that. But what really struck me in the historical account is that it just says: "In 1866 the prisoners escaped." Then they joined the Crown in another battle at Ngātapa.</p><p class="a">If we can just think back to the amazing ingenuity of Māori—the amazing ingenuity of the tūpuna of these people being imprisoned on the Chatham Islands, hundreds of miles away from the mainland, and they were able to escape. Not only just escape; how did they get back from the Chatham Islands to Tūranga—to Gisborne? They had to take ahold of a Pākehā sailing ship and sail it all the way back the opposite way, from the Chatham Islands to the East Coast. One can only marvel at the daring and the adventurous spirit and the desire of their tūpuna to get back home. </p><p class="a">I can just picture it right now. I can just picture Te Kooti, and I can just picture Hineuru tūpuna, and there were Rongowhakaata tūpuna there, Maungaharuru-Tangitū—they were all huddling there and saying: "Right, guys, we've got to get back home. How are we going to do this?". I would suppose that one of their group would have said: "I know, uncle. If you get the boat, I'll get us home." That could have been a Hineuru tupuna, but that is probably what took place. They were able to get hold of a sailing boat—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Meka Whaitiri</strong>: Schooner.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>RINO TIRIKATENE</strong>: A schooner? Oh, well, OK. A bit of a nautical, dramatical twist—ha, ha! But they were able to get ahold of that schooner and make their way back, gibbing and gybing—masters of the waves of the sea. </p><p class="a">I think that is what I would like Ngāti Hineuru to take from their settlement: draw on the inspiration of their tūpuna and the great bravery that they had in being true to their convictions and standing up for their iwi and for their people. I am inspired by that, and every time I see that story, I think, you know, it would make a wonderful movie to capture the adventurous spirit of their tūpuna. I do acknowledge Ngāti Hineuru, and I commend this bill to the House. Kia ora tātou.</p></div></body>

What I want to do, though, is keep it fairly tight and concentrate on the beginning of the process, where Hineuru provided the Crown with a set of pouwhenua, and those pouwhenua were really the guiding pouwhenua on this hīkoi to where we have reached here today for the third reading.</p><p class="a">Those pouwhenua, or pillars, guided the iwi throughout this settlement. I know there are people here in the gallery today from Hineuru. There are people who cannot be here and are possibly watching this live, and there are people also—rangatira—who have passed on, and we acknowledge them here today. Also, there were the Crown negotiators led by Paul Swain, as this settlement actually continued through to reach and fulfil those pou.</p><p class="a">So looking at the pouwhenua, the first one is the pouwhenua tuatahi, which recognised the protection of Hineuru history and culture for the generations to come. The next one, tuarua, was the restoration of the health and the well-being of Hineuru. Tuatoru, the third one, is the recognition of the mana of Hineuru, and this particularly relates to way in which the Crown's actions have diminished Hineuru to the point of their not being considered as an iwi in their own right. The fourth one, tuawhā, is the reassertion of Hineuru's presence in their area following the decimation of this key Hawke's Bay iwi by the Crown. Tuarima, which is actually the pouwhenua that will be an important one—they are all important but this one particularly—around the commercial redress and rebuilding the economic base of Hineuru. The final one, tuaono, is the recognition of Hineuru's roles as kaitiaki of the environment in their rohe and of their traditional resources.</p><p class="a">Hineuru have trodden a long road to reach this point, and indeed it is important again to acknowledge the negotiators—in particular, Ivy Kahukiwa-Smith and Karauna Brown—for the way that they have stood up to get the best deal they could for their people by negotiating with the Crown in a very, very pragmatic way.</p><p class="a">I want to also acknowledge the other rangatira of Hineuru, including their chair, Tū Kahukiwa, and the board of Ngāti Hineuru Iwi Inc. I know that they have worked hard to reach this point, and I will say, after someone who is a son of Kāi Tahu has learnt since 1996, the work does not stop now. It just changes and it continues on your own journey. Now that they have been charged with putting these new resources to the benefit of their people, I am confident that they will drive an expertise that they have, particularly in those who have been the negotiators and those who have been supporters—people like Traci Houpapa. When we look at that, that is really the beacon that will take them through to what they want out of their settlement.</p><p class="a">Hineuru have waited a long time, and they come to the final end of the journey. When I look at this, your deed of settlement, one thing that it reminds me of is that what is talked about is informative, but what is written here is binding. So, Ngāti Hineuru, ko tō koutou mahere heke mai tēnei. [<em>This is your future.</em>]</p><p class="a">On that note I acknowledge again the members of the Māori Affairs Committee. We went to Napier/Ahuriri, and we actually heard the submissions and we also took note of not only those who supported this bill but also some who did not support the bill. I think of Ngāi Tahu—not the one in Te Wai Pounamu, as you know; the one in your takiwā, in your rohe. But we heard all of these submitters and then we were able to come back to the House and make an informed decision as part of this journey through to where we are today. I take great pleasure in commending this bill to the House. E mihi atu ki a koutou katoa, Hineuru. [<em>I acknowledge you all, Hineuru.</em>]</p></div></body>

And a huge acknowledgment to the relatives of Ngāti Hineuru. All of them—elderly folk, men and women, mothers, parents, youth, children</em><em>,</em><em> and babies as well, a warm welcome from Parliamen</em><em>t.</em>]</p><p class="a">It is our privilege to have you here in this Whare as part of your hīkoi towards tino rangatiratanga. The Green Party would like to proudly support your settlement and acknowledge your efforts, and to recognise that in this House, on the record today, the invisible-isation of your iwi is laid to rest. It is laid down, and the nation will hear your name, as it should.</p><p class="a">I would just like to acknowledge that in reading the process of getting to this point it is easy to read the words, but then, you see, what does it take when a people has been scattered, their whenua stolen, their history attacked—what does it take to bring them back together to create this process? I think of all the journeys that you made to do that and all the journeys you could not afford to fund, to make. So you go to the big cities and gather up the people—you put out the call to the people but there are places that you cannot go. And in this process of drawing people back in, I think just what a huge effort it is to do that—to get people together to address their rights, their history, and their future. That itself is an enormous challenge and task for those who have been scattered to ngā hau e whā. So I just want to acknowledge you for all of that.</p><p class="a">I also want to acknowledge that your account of this process is a testimony to the complexity when so much has been taken—not lost, but stolen. You did not lose it. You were not on the way to the shop one day, and you dropped out of your pocket your whenua and your culture—you did not. It was not that you lost it; it was taken. And it was taken, as others have said, through violence. That is why it is appropriate for tears to be shed in this Whare and throughout the motu. Before we can move to the rebuilding of the pou that you have identified, tears should be shed. </p><p class="a">I would argue that my culture, Pākehā tūturu, should shed some tears when we read—if only we did read—the historical account. Some of us do, but most people do not. Most people in my culture in your rohe have no idea of the significance of this day, and it saddens me that we have not shed tears yet in order to be able to move on and create a decent relationship with the mana whenua. In our ignorance, we do not weep. I think weeping is a good thing, because I think it is part of healing. But if we do not weep because we do not understand, we hold on to our idea that our dominance is normal. There is nothing normal about colonisation. It is just a hell of a lot of work to fix it up—as you know—as you work on it.</p><p class="a">This settlement is about many things. It is Matariki—time to reflect. This settlement is a great one to reflect on. It is something we often say in this Whare—that it is a deal rather than a full and final settlement. The Green Party rejects "full and final". Te Tiriti is a living relationship. It goes on. Mai rānō katoa—keep talking. Keep the dialogue. No end—no "Tick the box, we have done it." That is not to undermine the fantastic achievement, but to say that it is just part of an ongoing and permanent dialogue on the nature of justice under the articles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. </p><p class="a">We say it is a deal negotiated in the flawed context of a Crown-controlled and defined process. It is about many things—status, quantum, cultural and statutory overlies. My favourite one is RFR. I was like "What is RFR?" when I first started doing this mahi. It is the right of first refusal. I find that fascinating. So they stole your car, and then you get to compete over, or you get to make an offer on, the hubcap—RFR. That, to me, is kind of interesting, but not my idea of justice. However, next time I get in my car I will think about the hubcap, because RFR is a big part of many settlements. It is a big part of this settlement. It is better than not having it, but it is not my idea of what the thief who pinched your car should do.</p><p class="a">However, to carry on, I just want to acknowledge that if this is the tangata whenua's moment of justice, it has got to be about whenua—whenua. Whenua in this settlement—there are places that are being acknowledged and returned, such as the Upper Mōhaka Domain, the Tarawera Hot Springs, and the core of the rohe, including pre-colonial kāinga and wāhi tapu. Those are so important. They may not be enough, because again it is the hubcap; not the rohe, but that one hectare at Waipuna Falls—you can call it a scenic reserve. They call it a scenic reserve, but it is the spiritual significance of that wai that really matters. That is coming back under the authority of those who are deeply and intrinsically both kaitiaki and connected in a way that I do not even understand because I left my water—my family, we left the water in Ireland and we have not got back to it yet. I do not know if they want us back, either. It is understandable. Colonisation makes a mess everywhere on the planet.</p><p class="a">However, it is really important that these sacred places are returned, at the very least to recognise the nature of those sacred places. I want to acknowledge, as my colleague Rino Tirikatene talked about, the memorial on Wharekauri and the tribute to the Whakarau, 36 of whom were members of Ngāti Hineuru. As Rino said, we can barely imagine that journey and those feelings that were invoked. We can barely imagine it. </p><p class="a">I myself had the privilege of standing where the riflemen landed in Tūranga—standing on the beach at Whareongaonga, actually with the Ngāi Tāmanuhiri people. We stood there one day and I had that picture in my mind, but I did not know your name. Now I know your name, and that is really important. We all need to know the names of the people who were taken to Wharekauri—some of whose wairua is still there, as your story recounts. It is so important that we do not just blur history by not knowing who was there. Why were they removed from their homeland? Why was this injustice perpetuated? As Rino said, we all look forward to the movie of the return. But there is a lot of loss and a lot of pain that goes with what happened to the Whakarau, and we need to acknowledge that. This is again—where is my culture? How many people in the rohe can tell you, if they are Pākehā, about the Whakarau? It is gross ignorance, and we will never sort the Treaty until we educate our people. It is never too late to hear it, and it is extremely humbling to hear it.</p><p class="a">Just a week ago I walked with Andrew Judd, the Mayor of New Plymouth, to Parihaka on the other side of the motu. There were 500 of us Pākehā walking, which is better than nothing, and I suspect that when I was young there would have been, like, 10 of us. So that is an improvement. </p><p class="a">But what concerns me is that when I asked the Minister last week in the select committee whether she would make sure that the Land Wars kōrero was taught in schools, she said: "It's a choice. The schools can choose whether to do it." And when I pushed her, she said: "The kids can choose." He aha? The children, who do not know the history, can choose whether to learn the history, especially the children for whom their dominance and privilege is protected by not knowing the history? Not good enough—not good enough for Ngāti Hineuru. Everybody needs to know the history, especially in your rohe. The children of that rohe, the next generation, who should be supporting the settlement and the rangatiratanga of your people—those people need to understand the history. This place needs to commit to teaching what happened in those Land Wars—what happened—because you cannot make peace until you sort out the truth and reconciliation of these issues.</p><p class="a">So it disappoints me when I get a Minister saying that to me in 2016, when, in the next breath, we are in this House trying to make a settlement based on Te Tiriti o Waitangi. But we are not going to tell anybody about it, except those who are in the know and those who have suffered and have fought their way back to this moment. That is not good enough for this country, let alone for the people who live with the consequences of Pākehā ignorance. And there are consequences. I do not have tell these people about those consequences. They are not historical consequences; they are current experiences of our tamariki, our mokopuna. That is not good enough—not good enough at all. </p><p class="a">So the truth of history and land must be taught and articulated. Which of the rest of us will walk beside you, Ngāti Hineuru, in support of your future? You deserve all of us to be there. But in the meantime, congratulations. Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou. We wish you every opportunity for a complete restoration of your tino rangatiratanga. Kia ora koutou katoa.</p></div></body>

According to the saying: "Titi-ō-Kura is the mountain, Mōhaka is the river, Mātaatua is the canoe, and Hineuru is the tribe," so to you elders, parents, young people, and infants of Hineuru who have arrived here amongst us today; welcome, come hither, welcome! I endorse the words of welcome expressed by my sister and brother colleagues who stood up before me and, as a consequence, my heart is very happy not </em><em>just for you but for us of this House of Parliament. Before I continue with my contribution I noted you and your people, my esteemed one, enter this House, the reason being, he did not believe that I would stand in an assured manner to support this bill and to validate your claim. Therefore, I want you to know that we of New Zealand First expended a lot of energy to support you today, so congratulations. </em></p><p class="a"><em>Even though much historical evidence emerged, I for one do not personally want to go back to those historical accounts, because we already know about those circumstances. But I do stand somewhat envious of you as a collective, despite the fact that this matter emerged in the second reading of this bill. I do rise once again to say to you that we of Ngātihine of the north remain envious of you. I saw the comments that came out of this proposal that you wanted the Crown to validate you so that you could be a tribe like us Ngātihine in the north, but we were never given tribal status even though in our thoughts we are a tribe just like you. As I see it you are a tribe; there is nothing else to say about it. Beyond that, I saw some reference in the commentary about fisheries just as we of Ngāti Hine did. Even though we searched for our name in that act not a single fish head at all dropped our way since that time right to this very moment. Therefore, as far as that matter is concerned I sympathise with you all, but I will say to you collectively, do not stop fighting; continue fighting it.</em>]</p><p class="a">I have said that I do not need to reiterate the comments regarding the historical background to this claim, other than to reiterate my feeling of envy of them. Their iwi is similar to mine. I am of Ngāti Hine in the Tai Tokerau. We are still looking for recognition as an iwi; we are still looking for our share of the fish deal—they are yet to come. But my jealousy is at the fact that they have had their claims settled as part of this process. After today they can look forward to the future and to leading their people to where they want to go. </p><p class="a">People have made reference to the chairman, Tūhuiao Kahukiwa, but we all know that behind every successful man is not only his whānau but also his committee. I want to just mention their names: Karauna Brown, as deputy chairman, Ivy Kahukiwa-Smith, Te Reo Spooner, Tirohia Bridger, Rēnata Bush, and Toi Tāwhai. Today we extol the virtues of each and every one of them and of what they bring to the table. But can I tell you, tomorrow most of your iwi will want to hang you because, in their eyes, you have probably made the wrong decision. But that comes with leadership—that comes with leadership. I say to you all, support your leadership. Support them. They need all the help that they can get because history will define them on the basis of what they do for their people, and without your help they cannot succeed. </p><p class="a">I can recall when I had the privilege of being chairman of my iwi rūnanga. That night, when I went home, my father called me to his room and he said: "Boy, I just want to say one thing to you. Don't think that just because you're the chairman of the rūnanga that you have the final say. Don't think for one moment that now that you've been ensconced as chairman of the rūnanga that you are the leader of your iwi, because if you perceive to be the leader then always remember to look behind you. Because if the people you purport to lead aren't there, then you have to ask: who are you leading?".</p><p class="a">Nā reira e koutou i 'hakamana te tūranga hei kaiarahi mō te iwi, māku e mea atu ki a koutou, kia kaha, kia kaha ngā tiakitanga o Te Runga Rawa ki runga i a koutou mō ngā rā kei te heke mai.'</p><p class="a">[<em>Therefore, to a</em><em>ll of you </em><em>collectively w</em><em>ho validated the position </em><em>as leader for the tribe, I will say to you collectively: "Be strong and may the protective powers of the Almighty Above be upon you in the days ahead of you."</em>]</p><p class="a">Before I take my seat, I just want to thank the Māori Affairs Committee and those who made their submissions, particularly those who made submissions contrary to those who support the bill, because without them the committee could not give greater consideration to the bill. </p><p class="a">In conclusion, I just want to thank the officers from the Office of Treaty Settlements, because they—and it is beyond their control—are often criticised, I believe, sometimes quite harshly. In some instances I have been guilty of that. So I just want to take this opportunity to record that appreciation, and to finally wish Hineuru all the best going into the future. Nā reira, tēnā koutou.</p></div></body>

I am humbled because I have never—and will never—walked in your shoes. I have no idea about the pain and the hurt that you have suffered through the loss of your land.

So greetings to you collectively, members of the House, and my appreciation to us all.</em>]</p><p class="a">I want to acknowledge the contribution from Louisa Wall to the House today. I think, within what she said, kāore he kupu i tua atu i ngā kupu ka tukuna atu ki Te Whare nei [<em>there are no others beyond what has been uttered to this House</em>].</p><p class="a">There are no other words that I can think of to aptly describe the hurt and the mamae that Hineuru have gone through over a number of generations. I have spoken about the intergenerational trauma today, and I think it is really important to acknowledge that from that time to now, Hineuru have come a very long way. This bill provides the opportunities for future development. </p><p class="a">I want to turn my attention to Part 2 of the legislation—in particular, the cultural redress. This item is not in the legislation but is in the deed of settlement, and it is a recognition of cultural revitalisation within the deed of settlement. I think it is wonderful that as part of the negotiations Hineuru, obviously, have requested, and have received, a payment in recognition of cultural revitalisation. I think it is really important for an iwi moving forward that every opportunity is taken to ensure that with regard to those things that have affected their development and have impacted on issues like Te Reo Māori, all aspects of our culture, there are mechanisms within the settlement to address that. I acknowledge the negotiators of Hineuru for having the tenacity to be able to include such a mechanism within their settlement. </p><p class="a">There are also a number of statutory acknowledgments within this settlement. The statutory acknowledgment cultural mechanism is an important one for every single uri of Hineuru in that every member of Hineuru has the ability to use the statutory acknowledgment within the different forums—for example, within the Environment Court—to establish and to have recognised their connection to these particular places. I think it gives that opportunity, without being questioned over their connections through those particular processes to that land. It is hugely important for our iwi and our hapū, I believe. </p><p class="a">I think also the place name changes—and there are three place name changes in there. If I can just read them out: Stoney Creek and Ohane Stream are to be known as Ōhane Stream, Hell's Hole is to be known by its correct name, Tauira Mateāwhā, and Te Ahimanawa is to be renamed as Te Ahimanawa-a-Kohipipi. </p><p class="a">So there are many, many wonderful things within the cultural redress of this settlement, and in the short time that I have I want to acknowledge them. Nō reira ki a koutou Hineuru, tēnei te mihi ake ki a koutou katoa.</p><p class="a">[<em>And so to you, Hineuru, I truly acknowledge you all.</em>]</p></div></body>

I highly commend your proposal to bring your connections back to those waters in terms of the circumstances for the multitude to chew over, insofar as whether Hineuru has a possible connection; if it has, there is an issue for Hineuru to sort out.</em></p><p class="a"><em>There is much awareness about local council operations in terms of seeking out your views and consulting with you in matters pertaining to the settlement of your bill. There is a provision for you to be on a standing or planning committee, shall we say, of your local council as their representative on that other entity dealing with issues concerning the Rangitāiki. There you are, the time has come to view that situation whereby tribes work in collaboration with regional councils on the kinds of traditional treasures that are there in their own region, as may arise.</em></p><p class="a"><em>Now you have seen the situation again where you have an opportunity to purchase that Woodstock chattel—even though the price for that might be too high perhaps, the main reason for that being that the mountain of Hineuru, which was mentioned to you, is there. Also present are aspects where funding is required to extend your work on your customs and on your obligations to the various characteristics of Hineuru. That is a good job for the younger generation.</em></p><p class="a"><em>So those are some of the benefits I have observed, plus the tribal focus for Hineuru in regard to the pillars to be erected for you own house—the six pillars mentioned for the house. I have been thinking about them and came to the conclusion, now that is a rare breed, to build a house for the coming generations so that they fully comprehend, this is what Hineuru means to your region, here is Hineuru's real objective, here are tomorrow's visions, here are the stories about the ancestors who live on inside this house that you are building. Therefore, there is much to commend you on.</em></p><p class="a"><em>Many, many stories have been set down before you and observed. In terms of these revelations, inasmuch as the objectives are concerned, you indeed have the remedy. You have the attributes to strengthen yourselves, but I am amazed at the level of support you are getting from neighbouring tribes—in other words, from the Maungaharuru-Tangitū Trust. Their petition and support arrived before the Māori </em><em>Affairs </em><em>Committee. That was admirable, because you have lived closely with each other; and with their accounts to improve, to line up our thoughts and connection as a tribe to Jesus, shall we say, less onerously—I have much admiration for you. I also note the circumstances in regard to the support from Tangōio Marae. It is wonderful to see these qualities amidst the tribe </em><em>around these kinds of difficulties in terms fulfilling Treaty matters. So I have much admiration for you collectively, Hineuru.</em>]</p><p class="a">I just wanted to acknowledge the benefits of this settlement and, importantly, the house that is being erected by Hineuru for the future benefit of the next generation, holding on to those very important aspects of their past, their experiences, their connections to their land but also, more importantly, of how they envisage the fruition of all those aspects of Hineuru identity to transfer to the next generation. </p><p class="a">But I want to end simply with the concluding statements from the Ngāti Hineuru Iwi Inc. and Te Kōpere o te iwi o Hineuru Trust submission. They conclude their submission by saying: "Overall the negotiation of our settlement is the best that we could do at this time. Our people have supported us through the ups and the downs. The ratification results showed that there was strong support for signing the Hineuru settlement. The signing at Parliament in April this year was a momentous occasion and we can only build our relationship with the Crown. Finally, having been through this settlement journey, we wish to acknowledge all of our kuia and koroua who fought to have the stories of Hineuru iwi told. We also wish to acknowledge all of our people who have worked hard and who have persevered to get us to where we are today. It has been a long, hard road for Hineuru but we are at the dawn of a new day where Hineuru iwi can stand proud and strong, and build a better future for our people now and into the future.

Over the course of time and by previous speakers it is noted that in the early 19th century Hineuru lived and cultivated land in the region between Hawke's Bay and Taupō Moana. Interactions with the Crown started from 1886 and were harsh. In October 1886 there was conflict with the Crown at Ōmarunui, and by the end of 1886—a few months later—it is recorded that Hineuru had abandoned nearly all of their kāinga and cultivations due to conflict with the Crown. Thus it started.</p><p class="a">So today we come to the third reading. Today we go some way to make amends: the Crown acknowledgment, cultural redress, commercial redress, and the apology, the last stanza of which reads as follows: "Through this settlement, the Crown seeks to atone for its past wrongs, and to assist Hineuru in lifting the burden of grievance and restoring the well-being of your people and cultural heritage. The Crown looks forward to building a new relationship with Hineuru based on mutual trust, co-operation, and respect for the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles." </p><p class="a">As part of this process I want to commend the Minister, the Hon Chris Finlayson, for his work, officials of the Office of Treaty Settlements, iwi and Crown negotiators, the chair of the Māori Affairs Committee, Nuk Korako, and committee members.</p><p class="a">I want to conclude by sharing this observation. The business of this House is always special but the third reading of a Treaty settlement bill is extra special. Early in this career it was noted to me: "Shane, try and be in the House for a Treaty settlement third reading. The mood is completely different to the normal cut and thrust of the House." I have now been blessed to be here for these moments a few times, and to me it is as if a collective sigh is expelled—the sigh of a hundred years; the sigh of a hundred peoples. And just as a sigh is a breath out, what naturally follows is a breath in—a breath that brings new oxygen, new life, and a new day. So I commend and exalt iwi and the Crown to breathe in this new air and marvel at the taste. What is that taste? Ah! It is the taste of settlement—tinged with sadness, but still sweet to the tongue. May that taste succour and sustain ngā iwi katoa for many years. With that, I commend this bill to the House.</p></div></body>

It is a day of remembrance, particularly in respect of those who are no longer with us. </p><p class="a">I want to make special note of Whetu Tipiwai. Whetu Tipiwai was a renowned kaumātua amongst his own people. He was also a renowned kaumātua for the Māori All Blacks. He was also an unofficial chauffeur driver for my predecessor, the Hon Parekura Horomia. There were many times that we would see Whetu and Pare turn up at huis at home, and when they got out of the car we would say: "What's wrong with this picture? Shouldn't you be driving Whetu?". But, in all sincerity, I remember people like Whetu. It is also a day of reflection, when we think: could we have done better? It is also a day of celebration at last, as we see the third reading of this bill—the legislative path is coming to its end. It is also a day of realisation that the work is only just beginning.</p><p class="a">I may, just to set again—and I know previous speakers have mentioned it. I do want to draw and make some references to the historical account in this bill, because it does give in a succinct way what the people of Ngāti Hineuru experienced. In the mid - 19th century the tīpuna of Hineuru lived and cultivated in the Waipunga and Mōhaka river valleys, and at Tarawera, Waiparatī, and other kāinga in the mountainous inland region between Hawke's Bay and Taupō Moana. In November 1851 the Crown purchased the Ahuriri Block of approximately 265,000 acres from another iwi without including Hineuru in the negotiations. The Crown also forgot to reserve any land for Hineuru.</p><p class="a">By the mid-1860s some Hineuru had converted to Pai Mārire. Pānapa, the Pai Mārire leader among Hineuru, established a Pai Mārire settlement at Waiparatī. In 1866 Pānapa and Hineuru rangatira Te Rangi Hīroa wrote to the Crown that they would come with a party to coastal Hawke's Bay in response to a Crown invitation to meet. The Crown viewed this party as a threat to the region's security. In October 1866, after the expiry of an ultimatum calling for their surrender, Crown forces attacked a group of people, including Hineuru, camped at Ōmarunui. On the same day Crown forces also intercepted and surrounded and then subsequently attacked another group led by Te Rangi Hīroa near Pētane. About 35 Māori, including Te Rangi Hīroa and other Hineuru individuals, were killed in the two attacks. Crown forces subsequently pursued Hineuru and other Māori who had escaped the attacks into the Hineuru rohe, and plundered kāinga at Waiparatī and in the surrounding area.</p><p class="a">By the end of 1866 Hineuru had abandoned nearly all of their kāinga and cultivations due to the conflict with the Crown. Thirty-four Hineuru individuals were among the 86 prisoners of the Crown captured at Ōmarunui and in the conflict near Pētane. Most were transported to the Chatham Islands and detained without trial in harsh conditions for almost 2 years.</p><p class="a">That brief historical account does not give the richness of what these people suffered, but I am glad that it is recorded in their settlement bill. It is a passage that I encourage not only future generations of Ngāti Hineuru to remember but all people of the Hawke's Bay and Taupō area. Every Government department and every local government that have anything to do with the people of Ngāti Hineuru should have that at the forefront of their own plans.</p><p class="a">The land loss in that summary is absolutely clear. The loss of land and the loss of lives through the two battles are clear. And, clearly, in terms of those who were imprisoned on the Chatham Islands without trial, that shows the severity of the breaches of the Treaty: land loss, loss of life—severity of breaches. The settlement today can in no way compensate for the losses suffered at the hands of these people, but it is a small recognition, for this House particularly, to acknowledge those breaches and to offer up a deal—like my colleague from the Greens has mentioned—through this settlement, to acknowledge that you have much work to do ahead. And I join with all members to acknowledge that.</p><p class="a">In terms of the day of realisation, I am encouraged to hear the planning—and I noticed this in the second reading of this bill—that has gone on to date in preparing you for the post-settlement entity period. There are the six pou that were talked about by previous speakers and in previous readings. The fact is that you, Hineuru, are one of the smartest people, for qualifications, which I would say may be second to Rongowhakaata's, I acknowledge. This says to me that your settlements will be in good hands. It is not for me to advise you on how best to use that. All I can offer is, ensure that your people are at the centre of what you do. Always remember that it is these young ones, whose histories and journeys are only just starting. So, as we celebrate when we leave this House that we have got over this milestone, there has been some planning already to date and there will be planning yet to come.</p><p class="a">Like many members in this House, I get to travel around not only my electorate of Ikaroa-Rāwhiti but throughout the country, and we get to see some quite innovative Māori enterprises that are going on out there. I am always biased when we are running enterprises—I want our people to be at the heart of not only running those enterprises but actually benefiting from them. And so as we stand and celebrate the passage of this bill, I too want to acknowledge the work of the Minister, your negotiators, the work of the officials, and colleagues on the Māori Affairs Committee.</p><p class="a">I was at the hearings that we had in Napier. Whenever I remember Hineuru, I will remember seeing my dad walk into the back. Right next door to where the hearings were is the hot pools in Napier, and that was where my mum and dad would always go. So they came over and had a nohi. So standing and supporting this bill, I remember people like that who have supported it. Just in my last few minutes—as I said in the first and second reading, and I feel I need to say in this third reading—there is land alienation and, as we pass this legislation, acknowledgment of your own alienation from land. We have to remind ourselves in this House that when we pass legislation that involves Māori land, Māori have to be at the forefront of those changes.</p><p class="a">And we have the Te Ture Whenua Māori Bill right in front of this House. Submissions close on 14 July. I have been running workshops throughout my electorate—Flo, I did not see you at Hastings, but hopefully you will put a submission in. It closes on 14 July. Please, whānau, have your say on the future of our whenua. </p><p class="a">I commend this bill to the House.</p></div></body>

Tēnā tātou katoa e te Hineuru iwi. Rather unexpectedly, I find myself taking this final call on behalf of the Government, but this is sometimes what happens to a whip when the House gets ahead of time, and that is what has happened. The final speaker on our list is unable to be here. Unfortunately, I am unable to speak with as much knowledge as others who have spoken before me have done on this particular bill, but I do nevertheless want to say how proud I am to be here on this day and to acknowledge the contributions of a number of those who have spoken before.</p><p class="a">I think that what you are seeing today is Parliament at its best, and that is because this is one of those occasions when members do all listen to one another with considerable respect and acknowledge very significant chapters in our history. Considerable wrongs are being righted today. Of course, as others have said, you could never have adequate compensation for the wrongs of the past, and we do not even pretend to be doing that. But, nevertheless, I think that with the expression of genuine regret and a determination to move forward from this and with the considerable generosity of the iwi in accepting the apology and the redress from the Crown, we have an opportunity to move forward much more united and much more determined to have a better future in our country, respecting one another regardless of race or gender, ethnicity or religion, or whatever.</p><p class="a">I am very proud, therefore, to have been a member of a Parliament that has in recent years made considerable progress in advancing the Treaty settlements that have come before this House. These special extended sittings that we have been having quite regularly on Wednesday mornings in recent times have enabled us to make that considerable progress. </p><p class="a">But, of course, that is just the legislative stage, and I acknowledge everybody who has worked so hard for such a very long period of time behind the scenes to bring us to this point, where, on this historic day, as we conclude the third reading and finally end a process that has taken so long, we can say to you, congratulations, well done, arohanui, and may we wish you and your iwi all the very best for the future, and thank you for joining the Crown on this historic occasion.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Bill read a third time.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone"><em>Waiata</em></p><p class="CentredEndingBold"><strong>The House adjourned at 12.07 p.m. (Wednesday</strong>)</p><p class="a" ></p></div></body>
