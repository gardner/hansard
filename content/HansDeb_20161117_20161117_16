I know that there were a number of applicants who would have met the bill, but the committee has decided to support Martin Matthews. </p><p class="a">My own experience of Martin Matthews is working alongside him for 3 years, as the Minister of Transport, when he was running the transport ministry. What I can assure the House is that he is a first-class public servant. His career in the Public Service started in the Audit Office, and I think the broad experience that he has had since his early days as an auditor through to being chief executive of a very large Government department will serve him well in the role of Auditor-General. We therefore unreservedly support his appointment.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161117 15:09:51" ></a><strong>Hon TREVOR</strong><strong> MALLARD (Labour—Hutt South)</strong>: First, before I speak directly to the motion, I want to place on record the thanks of the House to Lyn Provost for the work she has done as Auditor-General—and, before that, as the first civilian and first woman Deputy Commissioner of Police—and for her work with a number of the members of the House at the State Services Commission. Her public service has been brilliant, and I hope that although she clearly cannot take a normal Public Service role now, her talents are well used.</p><p class="a">The Leader of the House has outlined the background of Martin Matthews. Again, I have had the advantage of working with Mr Matthews when he was chief executive, in that case, of the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and before that when he was the Assistant Auditor-General. I say to the Leader of the House that Mr Matthews has a very good understanding of not only being a good public servant when the responsibility is to Ministers but also the role of the Auditor-General and working in that role, which has quite a different responsibility—a responsibility to this House and more broadly to the country. </p><p class="a">I think it would not be fair for this appointment to proceed through the House without referring to what might be described as an elephant in the room, and that is a case that I will not refer to in any detail but it involved Mr Matthews' previous ministry. All I want to say is that members of the committee looked into this very, very carefully, were well briefed on the issue, and came to the conclusion that Mr Matthews' handling of the matter was described to us as having been exemplary. That meant that something that might otherwise be seen as a disadvantage was, in fact, seen in the end to reinforce the decision that the committee previously made subject to this matter being dealt with to appoint Mr Matthews. </p><p class="a">I am sure he will be a fine Auditor-General and I wish him well in the role over the next 7 years, much of which time I hope he would be reporting to a committee that I chair.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161117 15:12:37" ></a><strong>BARRY COATES (Green)</strong>: We welcome the appointment of Martin Matthews as Controller and Auditor-General. We note that he is well qualified for the role, having served almost 2 decades in the Audit Office previously, including 8 years as Assistant Auditor-General. He then served a decade in the chief executive role for the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, followed by 8 years as Chief Executive of the Ministry of Transport. We noted in this role his statement, as a self-confessed petrolhead, that it would not make sense to own a car in 30 years' time. We agree, although we think it may happen far sooner than that. </p><p class="a">This is also an appropriate opportunity to offer thanks to the former Auditor-General Lyn Provost for her work. She was the first woman Auditor-General and we thank her for her exemplary service, particularly most recently her report into the Saudi sheep deal. We note the challenges facing Martin Matthews as incoming Auditor-General into this crucial role at this important time: a recent fall in New Zealand's standing in the Corruptions Perception Index, highlighted by the report from Amnesty International New Zealand. It talked about a lack of transparency and the rising public concern over issues of probity of public finance. So we think this is an important role at an important time. We welcome Martin Matthews into this role and wish him well in his tenure. Thank you.</p></div></body>

Mr Matthews has had a distinguished career in the Public Service, and my personal knowledge of him goes back to when he was the chief executive officer of the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. I particularly want to acknowledge his efforts in being responsible for the lead Government agency in the Year 2000 celebrations, and particularly the celebrations in Waitangi. It was in that capacity that I knew him, and given the to-ing and fro-ing of what happens in Waitangi in ordinary years, 2000 was a special one, and I just want to acknowledge his efforts in that regard. </p><p class="a">But I want to point out just one particular role that the Controller and Auditor-General has, and that is being "independent of executive the government and Parliament in discharging the functions of the statutory office,". I want to highlight that the Auditor-General provides independent assurance that public entities are operating and accounting for their performance, in keeping with Parliament's intentions. I want to emphasise the word "independent". I am sure that Mr Matthews is aware of that and will discharge his duties in such a manner. We in New Zealand First have no doubts that he will carry out his duties without fear or favour, and we wish him all the best in his new role.</p><p class="a">In conclusion, we also want to acknowledge Mr Matthews' immediate predecessor, Lyn Provost, who held the position since 2009, for her service and particular exercising in regard to the independent nature of the position.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161117 15:16:59" ></a><strong>MARAMA FOX (Co-Leader—Māori Party)</strong>: Along with the other parties that have acknowledged the work of the previous Auditor-General, Lyn Provost, we too would like to offer our thanks to her and her team. Indeed, the Office of the Auditor-General has been professional in recent days, given that it has had no office to operate out of but still has performed its duties here, assisting the members of various select committees.</p><p class="a">We want to welcome the appointment of Martin Thomas Harold Matthews as the new Controller and Auditor-General. We note his extensive public service, as has been mentioned, but there is an even more interesting story to be told about Mr Matthews and his connection to the Māori Party—that is right, specifically to one of the founders of our party. Yes, the former Māori Party co-leader Sir Dr Pita Sharples might not have known it then, when he organised a youth conference some 30 years ago, but it was there that Mr Matthews first set his eyes on Heather, the woman who would eventually become his wife. Thirty-three years later, they have three children—we call that "whakapapa in action". So we would like to welcome the new Auditor-General and his family to this most auspicious role.</p><p class="a">We also note that Mr Matthews has links to the Hawke's Bay, having grown up in Napier, and ties to Te Wai Pounamu, through his parents and wife who are from there. So we extend to them our aroha for their friends and relatives who may have been affected by Sunday's earthquake.</p><p class="a">Mr Matthews has a huge job ahead of him as our country's top public-spending watchdog, keeping a close eye on more than 4,000 groups that administer taxpayer and ratepayer dollars. We encourage him to widen the scope of how his office audits taxpayer-funded entities, to ensure that it is including two further points in their work: whether those groups are giving effect to the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and whether they are recruiting a diversity of staff that reflect our community.</p><p class="a">The Māori Party views all Government departments and local government entities as agents of the Crown, and therefore they have an obligation to give effect to the principles of Te Tiriti—not just in those organisations that have a Māori name or a specific role to play for Māori, but across all public sector services, which Māori are high users of. We cannot escape that Te Tiriti o Waitangi is our founding document. Just some of Te Tiriti principles we encourage the new Auditor-General to look at are whether those Crown agents are working in partnership and good faith with Māori, living up to their duty to actively protect Māori interests, allowing Māori to retain rangatiratanga over their resources and taonga, and properly consulting with Māori.</p><p class="a">The Māori Party believes that if the Office of the Auditor-General gives more credence to Te Tiriti, we will be able to assess whether the spend is fit for service to all communities as well as to Māori. For years the party has been calling for all legislation to be measured against Te Tiriti as a value-add to the legislative framework. We believe there is space to be made for our country's founding document in the work of the Office of the Auditor-General.</p><p class="a">We also think that the Office of the Auditor-General should be asking the groups at audits how many staff they have of diverse ethnicities that better reflect their community. Our party believes that there is an unconscious bias across out public sector—this is the palatable term; the other term is "institutional racism". We know that the only way to tackle that is by ensuring the principles of Te Tiriti are upheld.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Motion agreed to.</p></div></body>
