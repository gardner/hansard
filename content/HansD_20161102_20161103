It is a really important bill. We are in a country where we live with innovators and people who like to develop products that help our primary industries along, and what this bill does, effectively, is extend the time that the data is kept private, so that it gives them an opportunity to get a return on their investment. It is also for if they want to change the use—so if there is another use for that data, they get more years to be able to hold on to it.</p><p class="a">I think it can only do good things for innovation in this country and also for others who are wanting to invest over here in that innovative space—because we are always looking for new ideas and ways to do better agriculture, particularly as we move into the realms of climate change, etc. It is a pleasure to commend this bill to the House.

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 09:03:17" ></a><strong>Hon DAMIEN O'</strong><strong>CONNOR (Labour—West Coast - Tasman)</strong>: I understand that Mr Smith is away. I know it is a bit early in the morning to be talking about wine, but I am sure there will be a few members in the House who might still have some memories of it. Can I just say that this is a very important bill, and it moves into effect what was passed in 2006. Since 2006—10 years ago—a lot has happened in New Zealand across the agribusiness sector. A lot has happened in the wine industry, and, clearly, there is a greater appreciation for the need to protect the intellectual property and the brands that we have built up and are now so very proud of. This bill will give protection to Marlborough sauvignon blanc and to Central Otago pinot noir, and it will ensure that what we say is in the bottle indeed comes from the area to which the label refers. </p><p class="a">In 2006, with the best of intentions, the general purpose being the same, there was the possibility that wine from overseas could have come in—up to 15 percent of any bottle by volume—and could have, arguably, tainted the integrity of the brand for something like Marlborough sauvignon blanc. That door has now been closed, and, in fact, anyone who purchases a bottle of Marlborough sauvignon blanc will know that 85 percent comes from Marlborough and possibly 15 percent from somewhere else in New Zealand. But, clearly, we have moved, and those who are smart will have all their wine from Marlborough if they call it Marlborough sauvignon blanc. </p><p class="a">What the Opposition, although supporting the bill, is concerned about is perhaps the lost opportunity. We heard time after time from submitters to the select committee and from officials that it is absolutely essential that consumers know where their grapes are grown and where their wine comes from, because it is about the integrity of the product. But the Government refuses to move on the area of country-of-origin labelling—that is, identifying where food comes from across the rest of the consumer market. What absolute hypocrisy that we could have officials coming and saying such strong things about alcohol—which, arguably, is the least risk, I have to say, from a food safety perspective—and refusing to acknowledge that country-of-origin labelling should rightfully be imposed for consumers of products other than alcohol. </p><p class="a">But, anyway, moving right on from that, where the Government will find that it has some trouble is that if it wants to make any progress on a EU trade deal, then—we have been told very clearly—unless we have geographical indicators for food, and unless we implement country-of-origin labelling, which is actually an overarching umbrella for geographical indicators, we are not going to have any trade deal, and that is the reality. The Government has missed the opportunity through this piece of legislation to actually move us ahead and to be in a better position to take up any offer of a trade deal with the EU, and so we are going to be back in the House with another geographical indicators piece of legislation that refers to food. I do not mind that; I think it is the smartest thing we could do, but once again the Government misses the opportunity. </p><p class="a">My personal view is that I represent an amazing electorate called West Coast - Tasman—two distinct geographical areas; three, really, but two that are well known: the West Coast, bound by the Southern Alps, and Golden Bay. These are two areas that, in my view, should have geographical indicator protection for the products that we produce: seafood, dairy, beef products. Both of those areas, in my view, should, over time, aim to have an international reputation for fine quality and safe food, but it is a brand that they have to, firstly, realise the value of and then work to develop. And then, hopefully, a visionary Government, a Labour-led Government, will come with a geographical indicators piece of legislation that will ensure that.</p><p class="a">In fact, the Rangitīkei, where the chairman of the Primary Production Committee comes from, might even have some value in developing a brand. I mean, he tells me that it is a nice area up there, that maybe there is some value in having a geographical indicator, provenance, or appellation. There are a number of terms for it, but what it says is that the product that we are selling to the consumer comes from a distinct area and that there are some qualities unique to that that are worth paying a bit more for—because that is what we are about here. It is about value adding. </p><p class="a">I say to this House and to the Government members of the select committee, who missed the opportunity to move in this area, that we need geographical indicator legislation for food and for regions like Golden Bay and the West Coast, where innovative producers of fine products can build a brand and sell to the rest of the world and tell a story about their magnificent region and why the qualities of their product are different from those of somewhere else in the world. Indeed, unless we accept and embrace that and promote that, New Zealand does not have a good future. </p><p class="a">Last night I was at Landcorp, where those from Landcorp were promoting Pamu as a brand. It relates to their operation, their systems of production, and it depends, of course, upon the provenance of New Zealand Inc., that of our country, but I think that as they move down the path to, I guess, higher value and more brand distinction, they will be looking to identify, perhaps, the meat from the Mackenzie Country, or the wool from Mackenzie Country as Icebreaker does. This is an amazing area of opportunity for New Zealand as a primary producing country, and the passage of this legislation is needed. It is, effectively, an update on the 2006 piece of legislation. </p><p class="a">There is a lot of passion about wine—it must be something related to the passion to drink it. But there is a passion about wine and the need to protect it and how well it has done in the international market. I have to acknowledge the wonderful growth in exports, but also too in other areas of primary production, we should be using the same wisdom. It may seem repetitive, but unless we get that message through, not just to the company executives but all the way down, through to traders, to the stock agents, and to the farmers themselves, we are not going to get a realisation of the underlying value that we have in this country for the amazing production of quality, pasture-fed—for the most part—protein and fibre to the rest of the world. </p><p class="a">We miss the opportunities every single day because the Government sits on its hands and does not facilitate the growth of that branding and the growth of collaboration across the primary sector. I have said to the Minister for Primary Industries and to members of the select committee that we must move faster. Ireland has developed Origin Green. The Ministry for Primary Industries and the Minister have woken up to it 5 years down the track, and they are just now trying to discover why the Irish are making such good progress: the Irish realise that their country has some unique attributes and they are going out and building on those. </p><p class="a">This piece of legislation says that for wine only we have got some wonderful attributes: Martinborough, Marlborough, and Central Otago, and there will be other areas like Waipara as well. As they build distinct brands and distinct taste profiles for their products, they need to have protection through legislation so that no one else in the world can sell a product using those terms. There will still be, as we have pointed out here, the risk that others might sell wine as "in the style of Marlborough sauvignon blanc.", but it is not Marlborough sauvignon blanc. So our challenge now, and the challenge for those people, is to get out and market to the consumer the importance of reading the label carefully and knowing that it is Marlborough sauvignon blanc, not "in the style of". </p><p class="a">I think that the select committee has done a good job to tidy this up, but the Government has missed the opportunity to ensure that country-of-origin labelling and geographical indicators—that is, appellation and provenance—are legislated for for the whole of our primary food-producing sector.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 09:13:19" ></a><strong>IAN McKELVIE (National—Rangitīkei)</strong>: It is a pleasure to speak on the Geographical Indications (Wine and Spirits) Registration Amendment Bill—hence the reason why we are dealing with wines and spirits here and not sheepmeat and all sorts of other things. But I will get on to that a little later.</p><p class="a">Is it not nice to be talking about some positive legislation—legislation that adds value for an industry on the move, an industry that last year produced $1.6 billion worth of income for the New Zealand economy. The industry is growing at a rate of about 10 percent a year, which is pretty significant. It is also a really interesting example of how regional fortunes change around New Zealand. Some members will remember the Marlborough Plains of 30 years ago. They were pretty rocky, and if they did not have water on them they were brown—the same colour as this House—at all times. Now when you fly over the Marlborough Plains they are completely different and are producing a good deal of the $1.6 billion worth of wine that leaves New Zealand every year. It is a pretty amazing performance, really, and you can see that the same thing is happening in Gisborne, Hawke's Bay, Central Otago and other parts of New Zealand.</p><p class="a">This bill is a result of an obligation under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. These oblige New Zealand, effectively, to provide protection for geographical indicators. A geographical indicator indicates that a wine or spirit comes from a particular region, and I guess two that come to mind very readily internationally are Scotch whisky and champagne. Of course, in New Zealand we have, as the previous speaker alluded to, many other geographical indicators that will be picked up as a result of the development of this legislation.</p><p class="a">Although I have three wine growers in the Rangitīkei electorate, I find it highly unlikely that we will have a Rangitīkei wine registered. Of course, the other thing about it is that speaking about wine at this time of the day is quite dangerous for us laymen because they always say that if you are thinking about it at 9 o'clock in the morning you are in trouble by 6.</p><p class="a">I want to speak very briefly about a topic that the last speaker, Damien O'Connor, touched on, because I think it is equally important. If you think about the Rangitīkei, for example, maybe one day we will see Rangitīkei land registered as a geographical indicator. I think it raises a very good point, which was part of a quite lengthy discussion we had in the select committee on this very topic. Of course, this piece of legislation is specific to wines and spirits, and it is an amendment of an Act that was put in place in 2006 but never implemented. That is why we have not dealt with the other points around geographical indicators in the course of this discussion. I am sure that, as the last speaker, Damien O'Connor, said, this will be an issue that comes back before a select committee in the future—and, I hope, reasonably quickly, because, I think, again, if you refer to the Pamu brand, which Damien O'Connor spoke about and which we visited last night, that type of branding is changing the world very quickly. Lewis Road Creamery is a good example of that type of branding. I think it is going to be hugely—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Damien </strong><strong>O'</strong><strong>Connor</strong>: This member should be a Minister.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>IAN McKELVIE</strong>: Ha, ha! Certainly not! It is going to be hugely important for the future of New Zealand exports. The days of us exporting bulk commodities are long gone, and although we still rely on that type of export to some extent, it certainly needs to change. This is a way that it will change.</p><p class="a">We received some 38 submissions on this bill, pretty much all of them agreeing with the bill. I just want to touch on a couple of other things the bill deals with, because they did engender some interesting discussion. It contains what are called "opposition procedures". I would have thought that anyone can protest a thing if they do not like it, but "opposition procedures"—which, clearly, is a legal term we use to describe how you oppose something—allow an interested person to protest or oppose the registration of geographical indicators. An "interested person" is defined in the principal Act, so there is no issue with that. The bill also allows for objection on cultural lines, and we can be confident that this cannot be abused, as it did create quite some considerable discussion around the select committee table from one particular member. These conditions mirror a provision in the Trade Marks Act, which has long been enforced and has never really been challenged. I think that we can be sure that those types of provisions, from our perspective, are going to create the right impact—they are not going to cause any problems, I think.</p><p class="a">I want to thank the select committee for some quite interesting discussion. With a bit of luck, we will have got most of this morning's select committee discussion out of the way here in the House before we get to the select committee meeting, so we will have a much quicker select committee process than usual. The discussion that the Opposition has already raised this morning is one that we have every time we have a select committee meeting, and no doubt it will come back again.</p><p class="a">I want to thank the committee members for the great bit of work they have done on this piece of legislation. I also want to congratulate Minister Goldsmith on getting this legislation to the post and on choosing the Primary Production Committee to deal with it. He was so enthusiastic about this bill that he was even seen last night wearing a geographical indicator of his own on his shirt. I have got a great deal of pleasure in commending this bill to the House for further discussion in the Committee stage. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 09:19:06" ></a><strong>STEFFAN BROWNING (Green)</strong>: I rise to speak to the Geographical Indications (Wine and Spirits) Registration Amendment Bill. This is a very, very positive bill, as has been said, and we are very keen to be supporting it. There are some issues around it and things that we should be considering while it proceeds, all the same. I come from Marlborough. I was brought up in Marlborough from the age of 4. I live there currently, and just the other weekend I climbed my maunga, Mount Stokes, or Aorere, in the Outer Sounds. The area is very, very precious to me but, unfortunately, it has become degraded somewhat, and the reason for this bill is part of that. </p><p class="a">Those names of Marlborough, Awatere, Wairau, Kaikōura, and maybe Kekerengu may end up as names that have the protection that will really emphasise the positive features around this industry. I also think that we should be exploring other aspects of the food industry in this as well. I can think of Marlborough garlic, for example—that is the best area in New Zealand for growing it. We are very well known for that. In Otago we have got apricots. We did actually lose a lot of apricots growing in Marlborough to wine, as the wine has been shown to be maybe more consistently lucrative for landowners in the area. </p><p class="a">This is positive legislation. The move, as someone previously said, for the Marlborough Plains—she said the Wairau Plains—through to the Awatere Valley, into grapes has been phenomenal. It is a major economic shift for the region. But our diversity has gone as well, and so has the New Zealand ownership of that land—it has gone as well. Most that will benefit from this are overseas companies that are selling—or actually growing, but certainly controlling—the wine out of our region, and that is anathema. </p><p class="a">I just noticed the new statistics on overseas ownership, and there is a lot of Chinese money in there and there is a lot of US money in there. Constellation, one of the US companies, is just moving through some very valuable land that would do much better food production, and it is just converting that. But not only that; it is bringing in its pesticide regimes more and more. We are having some growth in organics in the area, but this good labelling—Marlborough, Awatere, Kaikōura maybe—is likely to be lessened. It is at risk. </p><p class="a">At the moment—and some members in here will have shares in it—at least 50 percent of the surface area that is under viticulture, which is the dominant thing in Marlborough, is herbicide covered, because in spring they think they will warm the ground and get some frost protection by doing that. It is 50 percent. In 2007 it was 70 percent at one stage and it dropped down with our work on the issue, and then they said: "Hey, that's sustainable wine-growing." There is nothing sustainable when you cover up to 100 percent in some vineyards. There is a member here in the Government who had 100 percent when I was talking about it in 2007. It may well be more than 50 percent at the moment. I have not had time to analyse it as fully as I would like. </p><p class="a">Fifty percent of the surface area is under a probably carcinogenic regime, and then there are the rest of the pesticides, and the statistics around Marlborough, and the statistics in Hawke's Bay—in those areas—need to be looked at. What will "Marlborough" mean when we ruin our reputation? It was good to hear Damien O'Connor mentioning the clean, green image and what we are doing for Brand New Zealand. This stuff will help if we do it right, but it will not help if we wreck that reputation because of what we are doing in terms of the health of the community and the health of the environment. </p><p class="a">Just this last weekend I took photos of herbicide-resistant ryegrass. That herbicide resistance started in these vineyards because they were using glyphosates so consistently.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Todd Barclay</strong>: Ha, ha!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>STEFFAN BROWNING</strong>: The member over here may well laugh, but what do you use next? What did the wine industry want to use? Some of them wanted to use paraquat instead of glyphosate. They have got one tool they are allowed to use occasionally. That resistant ryegrass has now spread to the roadside corridor, and so the local territorial authorities are trying to manage their roadside that they might have done with glyphosate—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: Order! The member is wide of the mark on this. I just ask you to come back to the intent of the bill and its content, and just focus on that.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>STEFFAN BROWNING</strong>: Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. I am totally on focus, because my region relies on good branding, and what is happening is bad branding, false branding. There is not going to be anything to be proud about if the region is being given a poor reputation. There are some major problems with the horticulture there. We have got to do it in a generally sustainable way if we are going to put our name to it and somehow protect it. What the hang are we going to protect a name like that for if it has got a bad reputation throughout the world? </p><p class="a">We will be voting for this bill because we see it as positive, but hand in glove with that we must have those improvements that will protect our brand, protect Brand New Zealand, and our reputation at the same time. These names will be protected. They are already on a number of labels. But the same Government that is promoting this in terms of labels cannot get other aspects of food labelling correct at all. Some it has not even monitored or enforced since 2003, and consumers miss out there. So, again, this is a positive bill for what its intent is, but let us see the other areas of food labelling have their act cleaned up at the same time. </p><p class="a">In terms of the other areas that could come under a similar bill—this one is very specific; wine and spirits—there are some problems with that. Fonterra makes some very good mozzarella and other cheeses, and feta is one that I think the Greeks will push back on if we start to go down the path of registration of geographical indicators. We may actually not be able to use some names, and so those are some of the complexities around that. Registration of wine and spirits is relatively simple and it has a long history. In Europe there is a long history of areas being able to protect their names. </p><p class="a">So the Green Party will be supporting this bill for those positive things. We just really hope to see that Brand New Zealand and "Brand Marlborough" will be protected by some good sustainable practices. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 09:27:57" ></a><strong>RICHARD PROSSER (NZ First)</strong>: It is always a pleasure to follow my erstwhile friend and colleague from the Primary Production Committee and the Green Party, Steffan Browning. He has that wonderful ability that the Greens have of being able to support a bill but to do so very, very grumpily. So thanks for that, Mr Browning. I know it is early in the morning. </p><p class="a">I am very pleased to rise on behalf of New Zealand First to take a call in the second reading of the Geographical Indications (Wine and Spirits) Registration Amendment Bill. New Zealand First supported this bill to the select committee and we continue to do so because it is a necessary piece of legislation for the wine industry and for New Zealand's international trade. But I do have to flag at this point that our support might not continue beyond the Committee of the whole House. I give that indication because of a clause that has found its way into the bill to which New Zealand First finds that we are diametrically opposed. As with so much of this Government's legislation—as with too much of this Government's legislation—it is a clause that makes special reference and gives special preference, yet again, for no adequately explained reason, to Māori on the basis of race, and that is a great shame. It would be a great shame if New Zealand First members were forced to withdraw our support for a bill that we acknowledge is a necessary thing for the wine industry—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Member</strong>: You've got to be joking, man. </p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>RICHARD PROSSER</strong>: —listen and learn, Mr Tirikatene, you will understand; I will explain—and for New Zealand's international trade, both imports and exports of wine and spirits to the rest of the world, particularly to Europe, because of a clause that the Government has decided to include in it, which is not only entirely unnecessary but is actually counter-productive in a number of regards. It is counter-productive in that not only is it yet another example of the promotion of separatism but, at best, it could be seen as paternalistic and insulting to Māori. Members on both sides will doubtless argue that, yet again, here is New Zealand First being racist again, here is New Zealand First indulging in Māori bashing—the same tired old inaccurate excuses that they trot out for supporting political correctness every time New Zealand First stands up for one franchise, one people, one united people, and one law for all. The thing is that Māori is an official language of this country, and it should not need that kind of special recognition that it somehow needs this kind of paternalistic help and support. It is insulting, it is derogatory, and it does not need this special justification. </p><p class="a">Clause 21B is the offending article that has raised our ire. It will insert new section 39A, which is proposed to read: "It is a function of an advisory committee appointed under section 177(1) of the Trade Marks Act 2002 to advise the Registrar whether the use of a geographical indication in relation to wine or spirits, or the registration of the geographical indication, is, or is likely to be, offensive to Māori." The explanation given for the reasoning behind this proposed change, as is recorded in the report of the select committee, is that although the bill, as it is introduced, provides that "the Registrar must not register a geographical indication if its use or registration is deemed offensive to a significant section of the community, including Māori.", the bill does not specify whom the registrar should consult to determine whether or not the registration of the geographical indication would be offensive to Māori. And that is true, but, by the same token, neither does it specify whom the registrar should consult in order to determine whether or not any other given geographical indication might be offensive to anybody else—or, more specifically, anyone, we would presume, who is not Māori. </p><p class="a">I will come back to that point, but it is worth remembering at this point, I think, that we are dealing with geographical indicators here. This bill deals with geographical names and features that might be, or are, associated with wine labels and the production of wines and spirits. We are not talking about words, phrases, or cultural concepts, and for those who might argue that to some Māori, at least, and in some situations, these may well be one and the same, it is, essentially, place names and names of geographical features that are already in use, and it is difficult to see how their inclusion on a label could be offensive to anybody.</p><p class="a">There are already provisions in the law allowing such names, words, and wording to be removed from official use and recognition if they are deemed offensive, and indeed, the Geographic Board is undertaking just such an exercise right at the moment with regard to some names that although they might reflect a period of this country's history when certain nomenclature was not considered offensive by a large majority of the country at that time, are no longer considered to be so. There is a place in North Canterbury that is named and officially gazetted as Nigger Hill, and that is plainly no longer acceptable in terms of the values and mores of modern New Zealand. It is going to be removed, and rightly so. I do not believe there is a single rational person in New Zealand or a member of this House who would disagree with that. But that is a decision of the Geographic Board, and should not, we believe, be a function of the advisory committee to the registrar of trademarks. </p><p class="a">If a name or a feature is deemed acceptable for use as a place name, then surely it should be acceptable for use on the label of a wine or a spirit that is associated with that place or feature. Perhaps the Māori Language Commission could be consulted if there is any perceived offensive potential in the combination of certain place names with certain products, though, once again, because it is going to be established and gazetted—names of places and features that will be registered—it is difficult to see how such an offence could be caused. </p><p class="a">To return to my earlier point, this proposed new clause does not make any specific reference to any significant section of the community who might be offended other than Māori. That is plainly racist and separatist, and it is insulting and derogatory to Māori. </p><p class="a">We need to be mindful that this bill deals not only with our own registration of geographical indicators for New Zealand wines and spirits but also it deals with this country's recognition of the registered indicators from other parts of the world from where we import such products. On that note, there is a place in Australia that goes by the name of Chinamans Knob. That may or may not sell more wine, but it could well be seen as being offensive to any number of people in this country if it were to appear on a bottle of imported Australian wine, and, yet, we have made no provision in this bill as to whom the registrar should consult on that matter. The New Zealand Gazetteer on the Land Information New Zealand website, in fact, lists all sorts of officially recognised and, presumably, acceptable place names that could be offensive to all manner of people, and knobs feature quite heavily. There is a Scotts Knob, which might offend people of Scottish heritage—or it may well persuade them to buy more of the stuff. There is a Richards Knob, and I myself might choose to take offence at that, but the bill does not make any special mention of a body to be established or consulted in terms of asking me whether I object to that or not. </p><p class="a">My point, really, is that we do not regard this as an insurmountable obstacle. Agencies that already exist could be utilised in order to satisfy the requirement that "the Registrar must not register a geographical indication if its use or registration is deemed offensive …" without requiring another inspection of every application by yet another agency, presumably requiring the payment of yet another fee. Further to that, a colleague of mine suggested that we could go one step further and require that any such agency that is going to undertake that activity should make up a list of words or names that might give offence and the reasons for that before any such application is submitted, so that both the applicants and officialdom would have some guidelines to work with. My colleague suggested that in similar circumstances references to things that are sacred—perhaps names of gods and so forth—might come into play, but, again, we are not talking about those sorts of cultural concepts. We are talking about place names that are already in use and that are already deemed acceptable. It is unlikely that anything outside those parameters would find its way on to a wine label, and if it was to do so, it is more likely, actually, that that sort of thing would probably be outside the scope of this bill. </p><p class="a">So we will be proposing some changes to the bill when it comes to the Committee of the whole House. New Zealand First will be introducing Supplementary Order Papers to either scrap the proposed inclusion of clause 21B and new section 39A altogether or to, perhaps, replace the proposed use of the advisory committee for the registrar of trademarks with the oversight of the Geographic Board or the Māori Language Commission instead and to suggest, as I say, that whatever agency finally is settled on, it comes up with a list of names, words and phrases, and so forth, first, against which applications can be measured so that we do avoid the potential for any offence being caused and, also, so that we avoid the requirement for people paying unnecessary additional fees. We do hope that the Government will take a genuine, objective look at these proposals that we will bring forward. </p><p class="a">In closing, I reiterate that we do agree that in all other regards this is a necessary bill. It is long overdue in some aspects, and we support its passage though the House at this stage. Thank you very much.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 09:37:20" ></a><strong>TODD BARCLAY (National—Clutha-Southland)</strong>: It is a privilege to speak in the second reading of the Geographical Indications (Wine and Spirits) Registration Amendment Bill. It never ceases to amaze me how one of the more simple bills, such as this one—which was, effectively, written by the industry for the industry—can still be almost derailed by some arguably more marginal, loose interpretations of what the bill is trying to set out to achieve by some members of the Opposition. It is always entertaining, though, having a robust discussion about the use of glyphosate, the prevalence of Monsanto in the New Zealand market, and so on. But this is an important bill for the wine and spirits industry across New Zealand.</p><p class="a">In my electorate of Clutha-Southland, we are home to Central Otago pinot noir, among other varieties of wine, and a number of our colleagues here, right across the House, have pretty important industries that will benefit significantly from this. New Zealand prides itself on being a premium producer on the world stage, and that is one of the things that can set us apart from many of the larger producers. We are never going to be able to produce as much wine as somewhere like the United States or key parts of Europe, but what we can do is differentiate ourselves and really put forward the quality version of our various varieties. That is what this bill sets out to achieve.</p><p class="a">I want to acknowledge the chairman of our Primary Production Committee, Ian McKelvie, who, through his primary sector background outside the wine industry, brought an interesting take on this to the select committee, as did Barbara Kuriger, through her dairy industry background. Also, I acknowledge one other member as well, our deputy chairperson, Stuart Smith, who has spent his life working for and on behalf of the wine industry. He actually developed this bill in the later stages of his time as chair of the New Zealand Winegrowers Association, so it was really good to have him on the committee to be able to engage with the industry and get this legislation into a good position.</p><p class="a">I think it is quite unique, really—our committee, the Primary Production Committee, does not consider much legislation, but the legislation that it does consider is, generally, actually prepared by the industry that is going to benefit most significantly from it, itself. That is part of our role in Government, I think: we need to be able to do our best to enable, support, and protect industries as they produce and export on to the world stage. It is a real privilege to be able to assist them through our roles as members of Parliament—to give them greater protection in that space, despite the fact that Mr Prosser was mentioning some more marginal aspects, such as some geographical or cultural indicators outside of the wine industry. But it was fascinating to hear, anyway.</p><p class="a">That is the main point, I think, that I just wanted to mention, which is really on behalf of—I have got a small wine region in my electorate, but there are a growing number of wine regions across the country, and each and every one of them is becoming more and more aware of the need to have that level of protection to protect their premium brand, which they invest so much in. It is a real privilege to be able to speak in support of this bill. Thank you.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 09:40:37" ></a><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: The next call is a split call. Barry Coates—5 minutes.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 09:40:40" ></a><strong>BARRY COATES (Green)</strong>: I rise to express support for this bill, for the Geographical Indicators (Wine and Spirits Registration) Amendment Bill. The Green Party strongly supports this. I must declare a family interest in winery and a personal enthusiastic consumption of New Zealand products. I think this is a fantastic example of a really savvy—excuse the expression—marketing approach for New Zealand products. We see New Zealand products earning a premium on world markets, associated with not only high quality but also with production values. I think we should not forget the really strong effort of the industry in moving towards 100 percent certification according to sustainability criteria, which works very well with geographic indicators, so that consumers know that not only are they drinking a good product but also that the product is certified as sustainable production.</p><p class="a">My point from here is that this bill focuses on wine and spirits. We note that in Europe we have Parma ham, Scotch beef, Welsh lamb, Stilton cheese, Jersey royals. These are geographical indicators that apply to products other than wine and spirits, and the question is: if we are serious about adding value to New Zealand's primary products, if we are serious about diversifying away from commodity products, if we are concerned about our clean, green image and defending it, then why are we not looking beyond wine and spirits? Certainly, we would encourage a stronger move to do so, so that we could celebrate Bluff oysters, Morrinsville cheese, Pukekohe potatoes, Ōhākune carrots, Waiheke olives, Taupō beef, and maybe Tokoroa kauri. In future, I think, we can hope that this extension from wine and spirits will actually provide a huge amount of benefit to the New Zealand rural sector.</p><p class="a">However, there is a problem, and the problem is that New Zealand's trade policy is very much aligned towards following US interests, and US interests regard trademark as being the primary form of identification of products and geographical indicators as potentially getting in the way. If I look at article 23 of the Doha agenda from the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which provides the authorisation for countries to pursue this bill, then we see that article 23 talks also about extending protection beyond wines and spirits. However, the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, the "TPPA", has provisions that focus on preventing confusion with trademark. This is a departure from the WTO approach—a departure from the trade-related intellectual property rights approach—which is primarily concerned with protecting geographical origin. We have here two systems of trade: one European Union system and one United States system.</p><p class="a">I think it is of deep concern that we are about to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, apparently—not without the opposition of a number of parties in this House and a majority of the New Zealand public—which would, essentially, be locking us into a trademark-dominated system and could potentially undercut the establishment of geographical indicators beyond wine and spirits. Therefore, we will support the bill to this next stage, but we would also request that the Government undertake research into the potential extension of geographical indicators to other products and how this may or may not be undermined by the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement ratification. We would remind the Government that there is still time for it to step back from the ratification process. We look forward to the Government response on that.</p><p class="a">We look forward to geographical indicators being potentially a far stronger way of defending New Zealand's image and reputation internationally and gaining more value for New Zealand's primary sector producers. Thank you.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 09:45:28" ></a><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: I call Kris Faafoi—5 minutes.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 09:45:29" ></a><strong>KRIS FAAFOI (Labour—Mana)</strong>: Can I just begin by agreeing with some of what the last speaker, Barry Coates, said in terms of the ability for this piece of legislation to be able to be spread further beyond wine and spirits, as it stands now. I do believe there is a lot more potential in being able to brand and market and give, as the title of this bill suggests, geographical indicators to a lot more of our primary products—and, as my colleague Damien O'Connor says, to be able to create a better narrative and a better story and a better marketing ability for our country and for our primary products. That was certainly the case when I visited a farm about 2½ months ago in the Wairarapa—a red meat farm in Wainuiōrū, I think it was. The farmer there, William Beetham, took us around and was very proud of his farm, obviously, despite the challenges that the farm was going through there at the time. He spoke of the ability for his industry to be able to tell a better story around their product.</p><p class="a">I am not a wine drinker; I am a whisky drinker. I think of the story behind whisky out of areas of Scotland—the history and the storytelling and the ability for them to market their whisky. I think we have got the ability to do that, not only with our wine and our spirits but also with other primary products. So although the legislation has got a relatively tame title to it, I think it really is an important piece of legislation, in being able to get more value out of our products that we produce here in New Zealand.</p><p class="a">I cannot go on for the next 3 minutes without trying to respond to some of the comments made by Mr Prosser. I actually think that the piece of legislation that we have in front of us has been made better by the Primary Production Committee acknowledging that the body that will have to decide whether or not a geographical indicator may or may not be offensive to Māori might need some advice during that process, and by its looking at setting up a body to go to for that advice.</p><p class="a">I find it strange that if the New Zealand First Party is fundamentally opposed to Māori being given any special consideration at all in this piece of legislation, it has waited until this point to make that known. I know that it was brought up at the select committee, but there was a first reading of this legislation, and if New Zealand First is fundamentally opposed to that, then it should have raised the issue at the first reading, because that was a rather significant part of this bill.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Richard Prosser</strong>: It wasn't there then.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>KRIS FAAFOI</strong>: Yes, it was. It was there then. The change in the bill that has come to this House after the select committee stage is the fact that the body may need some advice. That is the change. I talked specifically about the original clause in the bill in the first reading, to say that I thought it was good that if in some cases the brand or the geographical indicator might be offensive to Māori, that should be taken into consideration.</p><p class="a">Let me give you a potential hypothetical argument as to why I think that is good. If, per se, a vineyard were to be set up in my electorate and someone with absolutely no connection to the local iwi decided to call their wine Ngāti Toa or Toa or Whitireia, I am pretty sure that the local iwi would be a little bit concerned about that. I think the iwi would have the right to go to the body and say: "Look, these guys have no connection with us. They've come into our iwi area, set up a vineyard, and tried to take our brand in our name. We don't like that."</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Richard Prosser</strong>: But this is a place name, and do they live there?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>KRIS FAAFOI</strong>: Well, it might not be. I think Ngāti Toa or Toa or an iwi name is a geographical indicator, and that is the issue. If iwi have no ability to be able to stop that, if they find it offensive—and it was in the original first reading, it was; go and have a look at the original draft of the legislation—then I think they should have the right to do that.</p><p class="a">I also think that the body that we give powers to, to be able to determine whether that is offensive or not—it may decide that it is not—should have the ability to go and ask someone for advice, whether it be cultural advice, intellectual property advice, local advice, or historical advice about whether or not it is a valid claim that it is offensive or not. To come to the House now and say that this is something that New Zealand First is fundamentally opposed to, to me smacks of the party potentially not having read the legislation at the first reading, discovering this aspect post that, and now wanting to make a political point of it, which I think is wrong.</p></div></body>

It really is related to wines and spirits, although we have had a lot of good discussions around food this morning, which I think is great because it is about provenance and it is about pride, as well as being about certainty of the product for people who buy this wine. </p><p class="a">Parochialism is alive and well. There is a bit of an MP rivalry between Tasman and Taranaki when it comes to rugby, and, of course, Stuart Smith—who has a lot of knowledge of wine—and I, along with Nick Smith, agreed that whoever lost the recent game between Taranaki and Tasman would front up with a bottle of wine. We did not win. Unfortunately, Tasman did. But I got a text from Stuart Smith with the name of some specific bottle of wine from his region that he thought would be appropriate to pay my dues in terms of losing the rugby. </p><p class="a">I quickly got back to him—and I am never going to win a discussion with Stuart Smith on wine as he is an expert on the subject; I drink beer—and I said to him: "No. You are going to get a wine from my electorate." I have Vilagrad wines. I do not have much wine in my electorate, but I do have the Vilagrad Winery. It is recovering from a massive fire from last year, and it has reopened and is back in business. So he is going to get the bottle of wine with "V" for Vilagrad. Unfortunately, we did not have a "V" for victory. </p><p class="a">But that parochialism and those geographic indicators are about provenance and pride in what we produce. So I am really supporting this piece of legislation, because I do think we need to go out into the world and be absolutely proud of what we produce. I do not get a lot of chances to watch TV, but when I had do it is often a cooking programme. We have far too many cooking programmes, but I watched a British one. It is all about buying British beef and British lamb, and I think that we in New Zealand have got to be a lot more proud of supporting our own products. </p><p class="a">I was really thrilled recently when I had the opportunity to go through Taupō for a business parliamentary attachment. Louis and I went to a restaurant called The Lazy Trout. I opened up the menu—it was a lovely meal—and it had Kāwhia Coast whitebait, King Country beef, and King Country venison, and I am thinking "Wow! I'm so proud of my electorate." I am so proud of where this food came from, and I had to taste everything that came from where I came from. I went in there with no intention of having dessert, but when I found out that it was Taharoa cheesecake with Pirongia forest berries on top, guess what? I had dessert. I did not need it, but I had it. But for me, it is about that provenance story. </p><p class="a">I have been having a number of conversations with Wintec. It now has children making camembert in the classroom from our good dairy products. And I will put a call out to the dairy farmers. Yesterday it was fantastic to have that increase in the auction. It was really, specifically good to have that 19 percent increase in whole-milk powder and to actually lift stuff out of that commodity cycle, which we are so dependent on, and get some pride into our products. </p><p class="a">Last night I was fortunate enough to be at the Pāmu Farms of New Zealand presentation and watch a great presentation about Lewis Road Creamery. I saw the pride that there is in that product and the extension of the product lines that are going out, the marketing and the advertising—it pops up on Facebook—and there is now a new chocolate spread, there is ice cream, and a whole range of things. Building on that brand and building on that story is so important. </p><p class="a">While we are on the topic of food, we should not forget our fibre as well. We had a great presentation of what can be done in terms of natural and healthy carpets for our homes from the wool that we produce. Things have been taken over a little bit—well, a lot—by synthetics in recent times. </p><p class="a">I proudly stand here in support of this bill on wines and spirits. I do have a tendency to drink beer rather than wine. Recently the King Country Brewing Co. has started labelling and canning the King Country beer with the big hat on, and the Ragland Brewing Co. has also launched, so pride and provenance is important to me, and I support this bill. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 09:55:40" ></a><strong>RINO TIRIKATENE (Labour—Te Tai Tonga)</strong>: Tēnā koe, Mr Assistant Speaker. I am pleased to speak in the second reading of this bill. I have to respond, first up, to Mr Prosser's contribution, because I found it hard to believe that here we are in 2016—that sort of speech takes race relations in our country back into early last century. I am very disappointed—very disappointed, but not surprised—that New Zealand First is making an issue over the fact that there is an advisory committee, which has long been established under the Trade Marks Act, that is there to simply advise the registrar that a particular application may give rise to concerns to Māori. </p><p class="a">I am even more shocked that the member sitting next to Mr Prosser, Pita Paraone, my whanaunga from the North—right from where the Treaty was signed, a rangatira from the North—is letting his own party run roughshod over what have been hard-fought battles by Māori in this House to get recognition of the Treaty and to give expression to that through all of the mechanisms of Government and the laws that we enact through this House. I am really disappointed. I am really disappointed in that, because, yes, we are talking about geographic names and we are talking about wine and spirits, and we do acknowledge that this will be of benefit to our wine industry, which is having stellar growth at the moment. So, in one sense, yes, we are looking at that. But there are instances where there are sacred sites, sacred names, sacred places to Māori, and they may well have concerns about whether a geographical indication (GI) application has been submitted. It may give rise to those issues. </p><p class="a">I give a classic example—a couple of examples. I gave the example from my Ngāi Tahu side: if a geographical indication registration, say, hypothetically, would be made for Kaiapoi or Kaiapōhia—those very sacred areas where I dare not go into it but a lot of blood was shed back in those days. I believe that there would be real concerns. That would be of great concern to me and also—[<em>Interruption</em>] Well, let us use the example of how the member, Richard Prosser, would—and he can consult with his fellow colleague, Pita Paraone. What if a GI application were made for Ruapekapeka? Ruapekapeka is a very sacred site to us in the North, particularly to the member's colleague there and to the leader of his party. What if a GI application was made for Te Ruapekapeka. That is just a place—it is a place name. </p><p class="a">Here is another one: the Aoraki region. The Aoraki region is a region. It is recognised. Sure, you could say it is the Mackenzie region, as well. But those are examples where there should be at least some recognition, and that is what this bill does. It gives only an advisory role. Based on what the member is saying, he says: "Oh, well, we can deal with that another way." Well, there is a way, and we have put that in this bill. So whether he wants to consult with his colleague and come up with some other process—but, definitely, those are likely to be very offensive if there were applications made for GIs for those names. </p><p class="a">I am really disappointed that the member would set us right back by going back to the same old—talking about special treatment, talking about being paternalistic. That is insulting and derogatory. All we are asking for and all we have provided for is utilising the expertise of an advisory body that has long been established. I think it has been around for well over 12-plus years. All we are saying is that we are going to use the expertise of that body, which I know is drawn from academics, iwi representatives, and the like from all around the country. We are going to use their expertise if the alarm bells go off with the registrar on a particular registration. That is all we are asking for. That is all we are providing for, nothing more. </p><p class="a">So if the member could come back, I would be interested to hear how he would deal with a GI application for Ruapekapeka. If this process is not good enough, or if he just thinks "Oh no, that's just special treatment.", well then, I guess his colleagues will have to stand up in the North and say how they would be promoting such a view. As I said, I am shocked and disappointed—shocked and disappointed. But I do not want to belabour the point. </p><p class="a">Moving on to this bill, we do support it. We do support the amendments that we made at the Primary Production Committee. We have listened to the industry. This is a bill that is about promoting and enhancing the value that we can capture from selling our wines, which are in high demand around the world. </p><p class="a">I am very lucky. The electorate that I represent has some fantastic wine regions—Marlborough, Nelson, Canterbury, the Waipara Valley, and Central Otago—so if anyone wants to support this bill, it is me. I know that the economic benefits have transformed these particular regions around the country, if you do look at Marlborough or through Central Otago. It is good to see that there are Māori participating in viticulture and in the wine sector, right back to wines that I remember over in Martinborough, from Hau Ariki Wines—which was probably the first Māori wine and which is still over there with the person who was my whanaunga, the late Mr Hawkins—to what we see with Tohu Wines and the Wakatū Incorporation and what they have been doing, to other grape-growing areas that have significant Māori involvement in the Hawke's Bay and up on the East Coast and in Gisborne. This is a positive piece of legislation that we are wanting to implement. </p><p class="a">I do want to touch on the matter about country of origin.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Ian McKelvie</strong>: Oh!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>RINO TIRIKATENE</strong>: Yes, Mr McKelvie, I had to go there. Mr McKelvie said maybe one day—maybe one day—sometime in the future that might happen. Certainly, if it is good enough that we can do this for wine, we need a bold Government that will make sure that we can do this—the story of provenance, the story of where our beautiful bounty from the land and the sea comes from. That is definitely what we want to enhance New Zealand Inc., because that is what this is about. </p><p class="a">This is a separate issue, but returning to the point about the Māori names, I believe that maybe there needs to be some additional advice. We have just implemented Te Ture mō Te Reo Māori, a substantial piece of legislation to do with Te Reo Māori, and maybe there could be some input through the mechanisms and the bodies that we have set up under there into this process. But, for now, the advisory committee that we have recognised is more than appropriate to play that part. Therefore, I commend this bill at its second reading. Kia ora.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Bill read a second time.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="BillDebate"><strong>WILDLIFE</strong><strong> (POWERS) AMENDMENT BILL</strong></p><p class="SubDebate"><strong>Second Reading</strong></p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 10:05:39" ></a><strong>Hon MAGGIE BARRY (Minister of Conservatio</strong><strong>n)</strong>: I move, <em>That</em><em> the Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill be now read a second time</em>. I am very pleased to be able to rise to take the first call for the second reading of the Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill. I acknowledge the work of the Local Government and Environment Committee, chaired by my colleague Scott Simpson. The intellectual rigour those members brought to the process, the thorough nature of the approach that they took in examining all the details, and their recommendations have added value to the bill, and, I think, rigorously tested its parameters in a way that means that nature will be better protected. I will speak on those measures shortly, but, first, I think it would be useful to explain to the House and the wider public the context and the purpose of this bill. </p><p class="a">Our native wildlife faces many threats. Introduced predators—the usual suspects: rats, stoats, and possums—are destroying our biodiversity. Our Government's response to that has been to announce the visionary target of Predator Free 2050, and our Prime Minister is right behind it, as is our entire caucus. I think, too, the people of New Zealand have realised that our threatened species need better protection. Weeds are also a very big threat to our biodiversity. They smother habitat and food sources, they cause disease, and they cause a range of problems, hence the policies that I have brought in around the War on Weeds, naming the Dirty Dozen, and putting many millions of dollars, some of which I will be announcing tomorrow, around wilding pine control and other measures, because we acknowledge that our plants, as well as our precious taonga species, are under threat. </p><p class="a">Poaching is a very real threat, and, at times, it can be overlooked. We have to face the reality, though, that it is a growing problem. There is a lucrative international black market in our native species, our spectacular geckos and skinks, and that drives some people to break the law, to seek to take advantage of our country's remarkable wildlife. This can and does pose a major threat to its security. For example, reptile smugglers tend to target pregnant females, which is a real problem for the small, fragmented populations that breed very slowly. We know of one gecko population on the Otago Peninsula, for example, driven almost to extinction by smugglers, and another population where poachers took almost half the breeding females. My colleague Jacqui Dean's excellent member's bill, the Conservation (Natural Heritage Protection) Act, passed in 2013, and that increased and standardised the penalties for offences against protected wildlife, with fines of up to $300,000. It was designed to deter and to punish smugglers, as this Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill is. </p><p class="a">Dealing specifically with the problems of illegal hunting is important and at the heart of this bill. Over the past few years people have killed whio, tūī, kererū, kea, kākā, shags, petrels, oystercatchers, and herons, and tried to sell blue duck chicks. Hunters and domestic dogs have killed kiwi, gulls, and weka. The Wildlife Act protects our unique taonga species from being illegally taken, hunted, killed, or smuggled out of New Zealand, but its enforcement powers, which were given to Department of Conservation (DOC) rangers, have not been updated for 60 years and are no longer fit for purpose when our threatened taonga species are so in danger. Some of the language in the old bill is outdated. I have referred before to how it specifies that only men can be enlisted to help rangers. More broadly, the powers themselves need to be expanded and clarified to fit modern times and the threats that our biodiversity and our ecology face. </p><p class="a">The purpose of the Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill is to better protect wildlife by modernising the protection and enforcement powers available to investigate and prosecute offences against protected wildlife. The bill affects only the Wildlife Act, and changes only enforcement powers. It does not change the protected status of wildlife or how wildlife is managed. The current training given to rangers covers the ground, and making these minor changes to the Act will not impact on DOC's budget. They will, though, give full-time rangers four new powers. There is the ability to take action to prevent an offence about to occur or in progress, or to stop offending in progress, which will potentially enable rangers to prevent or minimise the harm to wildlife. In other words, they can act in a timely fashion to intervene before a crime is committed. Temporarily, they can stop persons suspected of an offence to allow investigation. This can be very important in situations where an offender is trying to evade the rangers or is trying to hide evidence of the offending. </p><p class="a">It will also enable our rangers to seize a broader range of evidence, such as laptops, cameras, and mobile phones. This can help build a case, or help to prove intent—for example, whether an offence is commercially motivated. Also, they will have additional powers requiring proof of identification details from suspected offenders—specifically, their date of birth and evidence of their identity. This will support rangers to get information that is legally required before a person can be charged. In addition, this bill grants the power to arrest. That is limited to very serious offending against absolutely protected wildlife, such as that involving illegal hunting, killing, or export. Access to that power of arrest is also very limited: to full-time DOC rangers who are specifically warranted to use it. That is a very small team of highly trained specialists, many of whom are former policeman. This will most likely be used for the serious offences that I referred to earlier, such as international smuggling, because these can pose significant risks to absolutely protected wildlife such as our native lizards, and because the suspected offenders are a potential flight risk. </p><p class="a">I welcome the Local Government and Environment Committee report on the bill, and the 14 tweaks and adjustments that are recommended—12 from DOC and two from the select committee, all of which have been adopted. They have clarified the nature and extent of the new powers and their relationship to existing provisions in the Act. The new section 39AA specifies which rangers will have access to the powers to seize evidential material, to require people to stop, and to intervene to prevent offences. New section 39AA clarifies that these powers are available to DOC full-time rangers, specifically those who are warranted and trained in enforcement work. They are also available to police officers and to fishery officers as well. </p><p class="a">They are not available to DOC honorary rangers or honorary fishing officers or to any honorary Fish and Game New Zealand rangers. There was, and there is, a very simple reason why this was the case. Honorary rangers are at arm's length from the Government. They are not public servants, and are not subject to the <em>Public S</em><em>e</em><em>rvice Code of C</em><em>onduct</em> which binds DOC and other full-time Crown staff who are employed by the Crown—and obligation, transparency, and accountability are very important parts of the rigour of this process. </p><p class="a">The select committee also clarified the safeguards around some of the powers. Any evidence seized must relate to the investigation of a suspected offence. The power to stop a person may be exercised only in relation to a suspected offence, and does not enable the use of force. A person may also be stopped only for a time that is reasonable in the circumstances. </p><p class="a">The committee replaced the existing section 40 of the Act to clarify the type of behaviour that constitutes obstructing a person acting under the Wildlife Act. The changes to the section take account of the new powers. The committee further amended the new section 66A, to make it clearer who can require identification information, and what types of identification information can be required from suspected offenders. The committee extended the ability to require suspected offenders to provide their date of birth to full-time Fish and Game rangers. That is, I think, appropriate for the level of offending that they are generally dealing with when they are managing game-bird hunting under the Act. The full-time Fish and Game rangers do an excellent job, as do the full-time DOC rangers, and I commend them all for the great work that they do, and for their sincerity, and for the—frankly—heroic nature of the work that they sometimes do in the field. </p><p class="a">Rangers are out in the front line of conservation, day in and day out, sustaining the very essence of our New Zealand identity. Our DOC rangers maintain the tracks, the huts, the reserves, the special places, and the landscapes that we all—including visitors to this country—enjoy so much. They make our nation famous to the world, they keep the standards high, and they care. They also protect our native species in the heat of the summer, in the cold of the winter, and in the driving wind and gales which seem to come in every season, and which make it very difficult for the young fledgling chicks to survive—our DOC rangers are there every step of the way. They do that work in the face of often ill-informed and vicious abuse from the likes of the anti-1080 poison lobby. I take this opportunity in the House, with this bill, to commend the fortitude and the stamina of the DOC staff. </p><p class="a">This bill is a small but vital way to help make their work a little bit easier, and to help them be even more effective in protecting our national monuments, which are our national taonga, from poachers. I commend the work of the DOC full-time rangers, the Fish and Game full-time rangers, and I commend this Wildlife (Powers) Bill to the House.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 10:15:23" ></a><strong>Hon NANAIA MAHUTA (Labour—Hauraki-Waikato)</strong>: Labour is pleased to be able to support the progress of this bill through the House and to support the consideration of the Local Government and Environment Committee on what are some small but integral steps towards modernising the legislation.</p><p class="a">I did not sit on the select committee. However, I know that from the considerations and from having read some of the submissions, it is clear that the committee took seriously some of the fundamental aspects of empowering Department of Conservation (DOC) rangers by way of allowing and broadening their ability to intervene, to stop, and to detain people for illegal activities. I just want to summarise a couple of those submissions. First, the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee and the suggestions it made around the scope of the stop-and-search powers, to ensure that the objectives of the bill could be achieved while keeping in mind the balance between individual rights and conferring rights to DOC rangers—I think it made some helpful suggestions, which the committee and DOC officials reflected on. You can see that through the amendments to the bill that have been suggested.</p><p class="a">The Minister of Conservation is right: protecting New Zealand's biodiversity does matter. When we think about New Zealand and our conservation estate, and the rich biodiversity that we have throughout—which we can share with our children, the next generation, who are part of protecting and cherishing the estate—it is only right that we try to ensure that DOC rangers have the types of powers that stop people from, basically, plundering and illegally taking our natural wildlife. For that reason, I read carefully the submission by the New Zealand Fish and Game Council, and I did happen to be at one small part of a hearing when it was there. It argued against being excluded from the provisions of the bill. I think the committee deliberated on this matter, but, in the end, landed in the right place.</p><p class="a">Some of the conversations that were had when I was at the select committee were largely around the fact that the Fish and Game New Zealand honorary rangers are just that—they are voluntary. They do not have statutory powers, and it would be difficult to try to confer significant powers on a group of people where, quite frankly—we did have the discussion during the public submissions—there could be a rogue ranger and they could just go all over the show with their powers. I think the committee, in good conscience, weighed up the submission from Fish and Game New Zealand and balanced that with some practical applications of what was intended in the legislation, and really narrowed down the powers there.</p><p class="a">The New Zealand Law Society also gave a very useful submission. It wanted to stress and ensure that the powers that were being conferred in this bill aligned with the Search and Surveillance Act. That has been the case, and you can see it in the committee's report back to the House.</p><p class="a">The Minister has pretty much extensively covered the things that were considered: the power to seize evidence; the power to stop a person, in addition to the existing powers that are already there for DOC rangers; and the power to intervene to prevent offending. Those were the key aspects from the committee's report, which many of the amendments focused on.</p><p class="a">On the issue of DOC rangers and approved officers having the powers of arrest, one of the interesting points that the report notes is that the committee has narrowed the scope, or the potential for interpretation of the scope being too broad, in the way in which these powers were going to be conferred. I think, all in all, that suggestion was a very useful conversation in the committee.</p><p class="a">The committee notes in the report that it heard a number of submitters and made various recommendations. Clarifying the classes of rangers was very important. Again—having only sat in on the submission from Fish and Game New Zealand—identifying who was intended to be covered by the Act and, therefore, who was not, was very well specified within the amendments being proposed. Making clear that rangers can seize evidential material and the extent of that evidential material, and, again, aligning those powers to the Search and Surveillance Act, gives greater confidence to the way in which the Act is intended to operate.</p><p class="a">One of the things I remember from the first reading debate is the fact that we have DOC rangers out there doing great stuff, and often by themselves. We want to make sure, ultimately, that in carrying out their role and that by conferring extra powers of this nature on them, they are safe and they are able to conduct these types of duties and obligations in a way that will protect them as well.</p><p class="a">One of the other aspects is the issue of requiring a person to stop and for how long you would retain them. I am sure that was a healthy conversation, and I know that a number of colleagues who were at the select committee will probably comment on the issue of detaining people and for what period. In the end, "reasonableness" became the operative word—being reasonable in that manner.</p><p class="a">I want to spend some time on commenting on the type of information being obtained in order for a prosecution to take place, and requiring that date of birth information is obtained. This is a matter that I know my colleague David Parker, who was on the select committee, wants to raise in the Committee stage of this process. It is really to ensure that if you are going to pursue evidence that will potentially lead to a prosecution, you have then got to make sure that all of that type of information and the people who can collect it are able to do their role. I understand that there was some discussion around an extension to make Fish and Game rangers able to obtain this information for that purpose.</p><p class="a">It had occurred to me, when listening to the Minister's speech around this—and it is purely from a safety aspect—whether there would be some kind of a review around the way in which certain parts of the DOC estate at certain periods of the year might be better supported because there is, maybe, a trending of activities and things like that. That is an operational decision—I understand that—but if we are going to have a bill that increases the powers of DOC rangers to be able to intervene and stop illegal activity, then looking at the operational aspects of whether or not the capacity needs to be increased in various parts of the DOC estate is probably a natural consequence of those powers.</p><p class="a">Finally, I know that the bill will go through its Committee stage and there will be some useful discussion around the narrowing of the powers, as suggested by the amendments by the select committee. There is ample time for that to be discussed through the Committee stage. But can I say, from my small part in the DOC estate that is within my own electorate, we are very grateful for the good work that DOC rangers conduct within our area. Over the summer period, in particular, you see a natural increase in the number of Kiwis enjoying the DOC estate and offering to help with the activities of DOC rangers, where they can. Just at the back of my house they are improving the tracks. If you are up for it, there is a great walk, with a number of steps. If you are up for it, again, you can help take stones up a stairway—called the Hākarimata Ranges, Minister.</p><p class="a">But can I say that, in so far as the DOC estate is concerned, these amendments, albeit small, are useful amendments for DOC rangers. At the border, when you see eggs being smuggled out, when you see things coming illegally into New Zealand—reptiles and the like—you realise that we have the luxury in New Zealand, being surrounded by ocean, to be able to protect what we have here and to be able to ensure that we can stop wildlife from going out elsewhere as best we can. In order for that to happen, amendments like this are very practical and useful to achieve that purpose. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 10:25:18" ></a><strong>SCOTT SIMPSON (National—Coromandel)</strong>: Before I commence my contribution, I would just like to acknowledge, with grateful appreciation, the speech of the member who has just resumed her seat, the Hon Nanaia Mahuta. I think she neatly and aptly summed up the opportunities and challenges that the Local Government and Environment Committee was confronted with in terms of addressing what, on the face of it, seems like a relatively minor change but is actually a change that extends powers to full-time Department of Conservation (DOC) rangers and, indeed, to full-time Fish and Game rangers to help them do the good work that they have done for so long and will continue to do to protect our native creatures that these days, sadly, are highly valued on the international black market. </p><p class="a">It is 60 years since the principal legislation was introduced. Most of us in this Parliament have not seen any change to this legislation in our lifetimes. So I want to commend my friend and colleague the Minister of Conservation, the Hon Maggie Barry, for introducing this piece of legislation to the House. I think it is a good piece of legislation. It is balanced, it is measured, and it is appropriate. It modernises a piece of legislation that has actually served us as a nation well, and it has served the Department of Conservation well, but it is time to modernise it. </p><p class="a">I particularly noted at the select committee, and the Minister made reference to it in her speech, that the existing principal legislation has that rather quaint gender-specific reference that was typical of the time. For instance, currently DOC staff, if they need assistance from members of the public, for instance to help them do their duties and maybe apprehend or intervene in a matter, they are permitted by statute to only request assistance from men. Of course, that is something we would not want to have, necessarily limiting the ability of people of whatever gender to assist and be involved in the good work of DOC officers, should they need it. </p><p class="a">The Hon Nanaia Mahuta and the Minister both made reference in their speeches to the delicate balance that we had to find in terms of getting the civil liberties aspects of this legislation in perspective and with the right balance. This relates to giving people some quite serious powers—the powers to stop, detain, and arrest. These are not powers that are given lightly by this Parliament, and nor should they be. So very careful consideration was given to how far we wanted to extend those powers. In the end, the select committee went further than in the bill as first introduced. After consideration and careful thought, we decided to extend those powers to full-time Fish and Game rangers, because they do excellent work. In fact, Fish and Game do excellent work, both full-time and voluntarily as honorary officers. But we thought, on balance, that the appropriate position to land this legislation was that full-time staff would be the best placed to do that, and not to extend it to volunteers, in this situation. I think that was about right. I do not think it is in any way a slight or a discounting of the work and effort that Fish and Game do in our conservation estate and, indeed, around the country. </p><p class="a">This is a very good piece of legislation. As the member Nanaia Mahuta said, it is quite a small piece of legislation but its impact is quite large on protecting our native creatures and species from those ratbags who want to come here, steal them, take them away, and then sell them on the international black market, which I think all New Zealanders would want to be stopped. This bill extends the powers to enable full-time DOC rangers and full-time Fish and Game rangers to do the job that they already do, but to do it better. I commend this bill to the House.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 10:29:30" ></a><strong>JENNY SALESA (Labour—Manukau East)</strong>: I would like to acknowledge the Local Government and Environment Committee as well as the officials, who have put a lot of work into ensuring that this legislation comes to the House. Labour supports this bill. This is a bill that will reform the Wildlife Act of 1953, with the objective of giving full-time Department of Conservation (DOC) rangers new enforcement powers when they encounter offences. Some of these new powers would allow DOC rangers the following power: the power to be able to seize a whole lot of evidence. Currently DOC rangers have the power to stop vehicles and to stop vessels, as well as bags in transit. However, this new legislation will allow them to stop a person, and, as previously discussed by my colleague Nanaia Mahuta as well as the Minister the Hon Maggie Barry and Scott Simpson, this is a power that is not given lightly—the fact that we are giving people the power to be able to stop someone else.</p><p class="a">At the select committee a lot of submitters were very concerned about the length of time that DOC rangers would be able to stop individuals for, whether they would be able to stop people under reasonable circumstances, and whether they would have reasonable grounds before they would stop a person. We believe that the amendments that have come through after the select committee process are actually quite sound, so that the powers would be given only by the Director-General of Conservation before DOC rangers are able to use this power of arrest, and that it would be done by written authority. One of the things that the legislation now clarifies is that instead of the power to be able to warrant—because the power of arrest is actually the power to be able to stop someone without a warrant, the term "warrant" has now been taken out of the legislation.</p><p class="a">However, we do have some concerns with this particular legislation, and I would like to turn to one of those concerns. My colleague the Hon David Parker intends to introduce a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) when we come to the Committee stage, and his concerns were expressed during the select committee process. Right now, the prosecutorial guidelines applying in New Zealand require all charging documents to include a date of birth. This is in part to avoid confusion between two people of the same name, including parents who have the same name as their child living at the same address. This is an SOP to address, in particular, the Fish and Game rangers being excluded from this legislation. We were advised by the New Zealand Fish and Game Council that its rangers are currently limited in their ability to perform their statutory role of enforcing game hunting because they are unable to require date-of-birth information from suspected offenders, and they cannot prosecute unless this information is given voluntarily.</p><p class="a">We were also advised by officials that although this would be a useful power for full-time Fish and Game rangers, it would not be necessary to extend the power to honorary Fish and Game rangers, because honorary rangers were said to be generally accompanied by full-time Fish and Game rangers. However, we were told by Fish and Game New Zealand that this information was incorrect. So the SOP that my colleague the Hon David Parker intends to introduce would be to address this particular issue.</p><p class="a">Labour supports any measures that would help our hard-working Conservation staff to do their jobs properly. Our natural environment is a massive asset to all Kiwis, not just for recreation but for tourism, as well. Tourism, as we know, is one of the main ways that we earn funding from overseas folks. We also must ensure that the environment is protected for our future generations of New Zealanders to enjoy.</p><p class="a">However, the other concern that Labour has is in terms of funding. DOC already struggles with the funding that it has to do the massive job that it currently does. Last year 1,500 of our DOC staff, out of frustration at the fact that they were being so overworked, took industrial work-to-rule action after being offered very little pay increase. In 2009 there were 803 DOC rangers, but currently there are only 637. So in terms of funding, in 2009 National's cut to DOC's budget was $46 million, in 2013 it was cut by another $8.7 million, and this year there was a further cut. We are going to hand over to our DOC staff even more powers, even more work for them to do. But, as we implement this new legislation, in order for this bill to work, the Labour Party is saying to the Government that it needs to fund DOC appropriately in order for us to ensure that it can do all of the work that we intend for it to do, with this additional work, appropriately. Thank you so much.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 10:35:19" ></a><strong>SARAH DOWIE (National—Invercargill)</strong>: It is an absolute pleasure to rise in support of the Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill in its second reading, and in support of the Department of Conservation (DOC), which is one of the most popular Government departments in New Zealand. It has a very wide-ranging brief and it executes those functions exceptionally well. It has dedicated staff on the front line and in its back rooms, going in to bat for our wildlife and for conservation efforts, and it should be commended for that.</p><p class="a">As such, I commend the Minister the Hon Maggie Barry for introducing this bill, which is well overdue—it is now 60 years that the Wildlife Act has been in existence, and it requires updating to give our wonderful rangers, full-time DOC rangers and full-time Fish and Game rangers, enforcement powers that are modernised and that are balanced with respect to individuals' civil liberties but that are necessary to protect our wildlife.</p><p class="a">Obviously, New Zealand is synonymous with its wildlife, with its parks, and with the nature of recreation in New Zealand, and one of the beauties of that is that New Zealanders can go into the bush, we can enjoy nature, and we can get to witness interactions or interact with wildlife in situ. Unfortunately, as my colleagues have mentioned, some of those species are very highly valuable on the black market, so we need to protect our ecosystems and make sure that those species are there for the enjoyment of all people. Notwithstanding that, of course, with New Zealand being synonymous with nature, our tourism industry is built on that—over 3 million visitors to New Zealand in 2015, and most of them visiting our national parks and wonderful spaces, which hold some of these wonderful, rare wildlife. And let us face it: New Zealand holds about two-thirds of the world's biodiversity, so we need to protect that, and we need to give our rangers the powers to be able to seize evidence and arrest people whom they reasonably suspect of committing an offence by taking these wonderful species.</p><p class="a">So I am very pleased that this legislation has been brought to the House. It was a robust select committee process, and I am pleased to be supporting the Department of Conservation in these efforts to give it powers that are modernised in order to help protect our wildlife. So I support this bill. </p></div></body>

The Green Party is pleased to support the Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill, but I think we risk some of the Government members actually overstating what is in this bill when they talk about the Act being modernised. The bill is quite narrow in its ambit. It deals with improving the enforcement of the Wildlife Act, but there is a need for a major overhaul of that Act, and this Government lacks the vision to do that and adequately support the Department of Conservation through ensuring that funding is adequate. We can hear lots of speeches from Government members talking about the important work that departmental staff do and the importance of the department's mandate in protecting our indigenous plants and wildlife and our special landscapes, but we do not see a commitment in the Budget to actually adequately resourcing that work. We do not see a commitment to ensuring that—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Maggie Barry</strong>: Predator Free 2050—visionary.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>EUGENIE SAGE</strong>: Well, yes, the Minister of Conservation may have a vision of Predator Free 2050, but it is the Green Party, through our Taonga Levy, that has actually come up with a practical proposition to provide the funding to support it, rather than the very ad hoc measures that the Minister has proposed—to provide just a bit of additional funding for kiwi and a bit of additional funding tomorrow for wilding control, which is a project that we support. But there is a total under-investment in conservation through the continued cuts to conservation funding that we have seen under this Government. The Government is very good at getting the headlines with all of its PR about how well species are doing, but it fails to look clearly at what bycatch is happening and at the continued underfunding of conservation. </p><p class="a">This bill is very narrow in its scope. What we need is an overhaul of the whole Act to protect native fish species. It is under the Wildlife Act that we see most of our native birds protected—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Maggie Barry</strong>: Out of scope.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>EUGENIE SAGE</strong>: —except the—yes, well the Minister is saying it is out of scope. But if the Minister had had some vision, she would have embarked on a more comprehensive review of the Wildlife Act. The Minister and this Government do not seem to care about the fact that 72 percent—72 percent—of our native fish species are threatened with extinction, yet not one existing native fish is protected by the Wildlife Act. The only fish that is protected is the grayling, and that is extinct, Minister. So if the Government had some vision, we would be looking at a much more comprehensive overhaul of the Act, to protect native fish—to protect a taonga like the tuna, the longfin eel, which is still being fished to extinction. As the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has said, it is on a slow pathway to extinction. </p><p class="a">This bill will be useful in increasing the powers that the warranted officers within the Department of Conservation have available to stop, intervene in, and prevent offending. It will increase their ability to stop a person if they think that the person is about to commit an offence, allow them to stop a person's vehicle but not hold the person for questioning, allow them to request identity verification and date of birth, and allow them the power to seize a broader range of materials that are connected to offending, for example, mobile phones and the like. </p><p class="a">But this is not the first time that we have amended the Wildlife Act. We had a private bill in 2013 that increased the penalties for offending, which is all well and good, like this bill, but it is not actually addressing the critical issues of loss of biodiversity and the fact that our native fish do not have any protection under the Act. The whitebait season has started again, and yet most New Zealanders do not realise that of the juveniles of the five native species that make up the whitebait catch—the kōaro, the shortjawed kōkopu, the giant kokopu—are threatened with extinction. That is the sort of change that we need to be seeing to the Wildlife Act—actually providing protection for these species, and the Department of Conservation ensuring that there are adequate freshwater fish reserves to protect them—not just fiddling by improving the offence provisions. </p><p class="a">The Green Party is supporting the bill. We will consider the amendments that the Labour Party members are proposing to put forward, because the advice that we had, in the Local Government and Environment Committee, was that warranted officers—State servants, Department of Conservation staff—should have these powers, and so should employed staff of Fish and Game New Zealand, but not honorary officers, because that was extending the powers too far. There has been a disappointing gap in the Wildlife Act in that there is no protection for our indigenous native fish, because they are every bit as important as our native birds, our skinks, and our lizards, which this bill is designed to protect through trying to stop smuggling, export, and capture of those species. The Government should be amending the law in a much wider way to provide proper statutory protection for all of our native wildlife, and not just the native birds, the reptiles, and a few species of invertebrates that are currently listed in the legislation. But we do support the increase in the provisions to stop offending. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 10:44:10" ></a><strong>CLAYTON MITCHELL (NZ First)</strong>: It is a great pleasure to rise on behalf of New Zealand First to take a call and speak to the Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill. In all of the years—I suppose it is 2 years now—that I have been speaking in the House, I do not think there has been one time that I have actually given a genuine nod of approval to Minister Maggie Barry for any legislation or views that she has brought forward. But today I am going to give you a genuine, sincere nod of approval, because I think this bill is quite good, and the amendments made by the Local Government and Environment Committee—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Maggie Barry</strong>: Good job I'm sitting down.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CLAYTON MITCHELL</strong>: I know. You are going all red. It is like you are blushing.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Maggie Barry</strong>: No, no. Don't push it.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CLAYTON MITCHELL</strong>: Ha, ha! But the reality is, I think the committee has done a great job in making some amendments that are here before us today, particularly around extending those powers from not only full-time Department of Conservation (DOC) rangers but to Fish and Game rangers as well. </p><p class="a">I have to lament some of what Eugenie Sage has said in relation to the funding, because I think that is a real issue, and I will touch on that. But the essence of the bill goes some way towards tightening up on poachers and people who are abusing our wildlife. </p><p class="a">At the end of the day, tourism, which is our largest GDP provider and our biggest export, is looking to grow absolutely exponentially over the next decade and more. That is largely because of our unique flora and fauna and, of course, our native species that people want to come and see and be part of. If we allow the proliferation and degradation in the taking of species illegally and we do not empower our people to actually enforce the law, then, clearly, that is just going to lead to the demise of what we hold absolutely pure: our "100% Pure New Zealand" brand, which the world cherishes and which we should be should be cherishing too. This goes some way towards enabling that to happen. </p><p class="a">The ability, in basic terms, to prevent an event from happening—so for a DOC ranger or a Fish and Game ranger to be able to step in and, if they feel that there is something that is going to take place that is potentially illegally, they can actually involve themselves in that situation—is a good step. Stopping and being able to detain somebody if they are in the middle of illegal activities, or are likely to be involved in illegal activities, is good. The reasonable stoppage time—the key word being "reasonable"—whether or not that goes far enough will obviously come out in case law when that is first tested. Perhaps the Government would like to consider putting in more definition and clarification about what is fair and what is reasonable. Of course, we do not want to be going into litigation with people who are illegally taking and plundering our natural resource, and then having to justify what a fair and reasonable amount of time was. That could actually open up all sorts of legislative issues around the time frames for which they were held. But it is still a good measure. </p><p class="a">The ability for full-time rangers to be able to seize equipment and seize assets from poachers or potential poachers is a great idea. Enabling a ranger to be able to take a laptop or computer or cellphone to use as evidence is absolutely paramount. How can you build a case without the ability to gather that intel and information that can actually go towards indicting those people and, obviously, convicting them of an offence?</p><p class="a">Finally, just like the powers of police to enable the police to get genuine information from those offenders—obviously, name and date of birth are essential, as well as addresses and proof of identification. Otherwise you are out in the bush, you are looking at or talking to a potential poacher, it is all going swimmingly until they give you an erroneous address of the person and there is no way to check up on that. These sorts of pragmatic steps have certainly been accoladed by New Zealand First, and we look forward to those being implemented. </p><p class="a">I note the time in which—28 days after the Royal assent is given—this legislation will actually be introduced, so we would like to see this bill expedited through the House. Again, it is a good piece of legislation, as it was last night with the Charities Amendment Bill. We would like to see good, solid, robust legislation that has full support of the House to be pushed through at some sort of pace, unlike some of the other legislation that we have seen be put through in the past. </p><p class="a">Eugenie Sage mentions that our fish are not protected under this bill. Well, I beg to differ, because we have got most of our native birds covered under this bill; all of our native reptiles, particularly the tuatara, which is a targeted species on the international black market—whether our own fellow New Zealanders are actually exploiting this creature or if it is an international group that is doing it, regardless, the tuatara is a very, very precious species and should be looked after. We have got two native species of frogs, the gold and, I think, the green—the bell frogs. We are not very creative with our naming, though, are we? Green and gold, North Island, South Island, Stewart Island; that was a guy who—you know. Anyway, bats of course—we have got a native species of bat—and there are eight marine invertebrate species that are protected, and certain specified native land all covered under this bill. So it does go some way. We do have concerns that our native species are being slowly but surely brought to extinction, and we need to do everything we absolutely, possibly can to ensure that they remain for future generations and they grow and flourish in this beautiful land of ours. </p><p class="a">Certainly, we could talk about some other aspects of that, but I do want to go back to what is probably the overarching issue here: this is good legislation, a step in the right direction—a modernisation, if you will—but funding is absolutely paramount, and we have seen, since 2009, a reduction in DOC funding of $60 million.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Maggie Barry</strong>: Oh, rubbish.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CLAYTON MITCHELL</strong>: Absolutely—it is here in black and white. I could come over there or I could table it if you like, but it is actually available if you just look for it. In 2009 we had $403 million, and in 2015 we had $342 million. In 2008 our capital expenditure within the Department of Conservation was $98 million, and in 2015 it was $23.5 million. That causes some serious concerns in relation to health and safety. We have seen our number of DOC rangers be reduced from 809 down to 637. We are expecting our front-line officers—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Maggie Barry</strong>: Stick to the facts. Stick to the point of this bill. </p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>CLAYTON MITCHELL</strong>: —to do more for less. Now Maggie Barry wants to chip in and be part of the conversation. No, you just do not like the reality that this is the truth and you are trying to shut down the truth from the people of New Zealand. This is the frustration that we have, New Zealanders: Ministers will not face the fact that you are being completely underfunded, and they are potentially putting our DOC rangers in harm by underfunding them—making them do twice as much for half the money. </p><p class="a">The reality is that New Zealand First has some serious concerns. This Government has overcommitted itself, has not budgeted its finances properly, and is causing all sorts of issues in the long term in many sectors—which I will not segue into, but I might just talk about housing, police, corrections, and a range of other things—but specifically, the Department of Conservation needs to be seriously looked at. </p><p class="a">New Zealand First will be supporting this through the final stages. We would like to see it hurried through. We would certainly like to put the acid on Minister Maggie Barry to seriously put funding as a priority for our most precious of items, our land and our native species, because at the moment, under this Government, it does not seem to be a priority and you are making our front-line officers do more for less. It is absolutely in black and white—you can deny it all you like, but, at the end of the day, you have had your lovely speech. We enjoyed it, because listening to Maggie Barry, of course, is like getting beat up with toilet paper—it is just so soft and smooth and silky. Thank you, I will end my contribution there.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 10:52:46" ></a><strong>PAUL F</strong><strong>OSTER-BELL (National)</strong>: E Te Māngai o Te Whare, mauriora. E ngā mema o Te Whare, tēnā koutou katoa. E Te Minita, tēnā koe. I would like to begin by acknowledging our wonderful Minister of Conservation, the Hon Maggie Barry, who does so much hard work protecting and defending the precious natural environment of our country. I want to thank the member who just resumed his seat, Clayton Mitchell, for the first 8 minutes or so of his contribution, which made perfect sense and which I agree with, but, unfortunately, he spoilt his otherwise good contribution in the last couple of minutes by engaging in some unfortunate numerical inexactitude. </p><p class="a">This is a Government that has invested considerably in extra support for our environment and in making sure the Department of Conservation, which does such good work, has the tools it needs, the resources it needs, and the staff power it needs to get out and protect our precious natural environment in New Zealand. I am going to agree with the contribution made by the Hon Nanaia Mahuta, who said that this bill is a good balance between the individual rights of New Zealand citizens going about their business and enjoying nature and the powers of rangers to be able to do something when they detect someone they suspect of violating the general principles and the specific laws that we have in place to protect our endangered species—all of our native species—our plants, and our wildlife. </p><p class="a">This bill brings in a great level of power to allow a full-time State-employed ranger to not just ask for proof of ID, which was the previous situation, but demand proof of ID—not just ask someone what their name and date of birth is but be able to demand it, and we are backing that up with the legal powers to do so. This is a huge gain, and this gives them a greater level of power than they have had in the last 60 years, but when we are giving stop-and-search powers it is important that these come with a balancing level of control. There are not, for a voluntary ranger, the levels of integrity and code of conduct controls that can be applied to someone who is in the service of the State—someone who falls under State Services Commission rules. </p><p class="a">So I think it is important that we do distinguish between an honorary ranger, who does incredibly valuable work—and as my colleague Scott Simpson, the chairman of the Local Government and Environment Committee, said, this is not to underrate the work they do. But when we are giving powers that could be considered by some to be invasive we need to balance that with a countervailing level of scrutiny. This is something that, as a Government, we have approached very carefully. We do not want rogue rangers and we do not want vigilante action, and this bill achieves a very good balance between those things. </p><p class="a">It was disappointing to hear a half-hearted, lukewarm, and half-baked contribution from the Green Party, which I thought actually stood for protecting our environment in New Zealand. This is a bill that significantly increases the powers of our hard-working rangers to be able to protect our natural environment and protect endangered species, so it is disappointing to hear that from a party that purports to protect our environment. This is a very good bill, it is a credit to a very fine Minister, and I commend it to the House.</p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 10:56:18" ></a><strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Lindsay Tisch)</strong>: The next call is a split call. Mojo Mathers—5 minutes.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 10:56:23" ></a><strong>MOJO MATHERS (Green)</strong>: I would like to start by saying that the Green Party absolutely recognises and honours the hard-working commitment of Department of Conservation (DOC) rangers and staff. I also just want to acknowledge that they have been facing a totally unacceptable level of abuse as the symptom of, particularly, DOC's use of 1080. I just want to put on our record that it is not acceptable that they should have to face that kind of treatment of having their photos splattered all over social media, their personal home addresses, and so on. That is just not OK. </p><p class="a">We absolutely do support giving them more powers to strengthen their ability to enforce the Wildlife Act, but I also want to affirm that it is disappointing that the real problem, which is the underfunding and under-resourcing of DOC, continues to be ignored. It may be stating the obvious, but if you do not have enough people on the ground, giving them more powers is not going to make a lot of meaningful difference to protecting and saving our endangered and threatened wildlife. We need the numbers on the ground, and the numbers have been going down. Eight years ago there were 833 DOC rangers; now there are 788, despite the fact that we have a biodiversity crisis in this country. </p><p class="a">So we support the bill, and we support it because we have a biodiversity crisis, with nearly 4,000 of New Zealand's precious and unique species at risk of going extinct. Eight hundred are listed by DOC as being at very high risk of extinction, and that number has increased by nearly 200 species in the last 5 years alone. Nearly all amphibians are critically endangered, it is similar for many reptiles and birds, and just last week a marine environment report found that New Zealand has the highest number of threatened seabird species in the world, with 90 percent of our seabirds at risk of extinction, as are many of our marine mammals. Not only do we have the dubious honour of having the highest proportion of endangered species of any country on earth, the vast majority of these do not have any active recovery plans in place, and this is a disgrace. The biggest threats to our native species are predation, habitat loss, and environmental pollution. So, obviously, coming down very hard on people who are smuggling or killing rare and endangered species is the right thing to do. But they are only the edge of the problem. The main problems are, as I have said, habitat loss, habitat degradation, and predation, so it is a small part of the picture. </p><p class="a">So we support this bill, but if we are talking about the biodiversity crisis, it is just tinkering at the edge of the margins, and this bill will do little to address that. We have to get real about what it is going to take in the way of resourcing and funding DOC to do its work. </p><p class="a">I want to give as an example, very quickly, of how this is playing out on the ground. Six months ago I moved to a beautiful area that is right beside a scenic reserve: Peel Forest. This forest is not being adequately managed for pest control, so possums are running rampant through the forest—so much so, that on the edge of our property there is one small self-resetting trap where we caught 11 possums in a mere 2 weeks. That is how many pests are going absolutely rampant through this highly unique and important remnant forest, which is very precious in Canterbury because there is such a small area that is left of the forest type that used to cover a lot of the Canterbury Plains. Now Canterbury is one of the most modified landscapes in the whole of New Zealand, so we should be doing everything we can to be protecting these last remnants, and that is not happening because the DOC staff are understaffed.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 11:01:34" ></a><strong>NUK KORAKO (National)</strong>: </p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised Te Reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]</p><p class="a">I want to rise in support of the Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill to highlight that this bill is a very important part of the Government's environment and conservation programme, because it will reduce offending against wildlife. Most of what we do in the conservation space is about conserving particular areas of land and the wildlife that lives there. It is also about regulating human access to those conservation areas in a way that ensures we can all enjoy these areas without causing harm to our native species. A lot of our work is also about reducing predators. Well, actually, it used to be about reducing predators, but thanks to this bold vision that the Government has, we are going to actually eradicate predators and make the country predator-free by 2025.</p><p class="a">There is also another type of predator that we have here that really does endanger our wildlife, and that is people—people who deliberately or carelessly endanger our wildlife by committing offences. But the issue we have right now is that the powers of the Department of Conservation (DOC) rangers to deal with these offences are very, very limited. These rangers are highly trained and trusted individuals who do a fantastic job of looking after our most pristine natural areas. I think it is appropriate that we are now giving them new powers to prevent offences against wildlife and deal with the offenders whom they actually encounter.</p><p class="a">These rangers are already very, very highly trained, and as a result of this bill they will receive further training to ensure that they understand their new powers and the limits to those powers so that they can apply them effectively to prevent the endangerment of our precious wildlife. That is really a big part of the essence of this bill. Under the bill, rangers will have the power to take action to prevent an offence about to occur or in progress. Powers of arrest will be limited. They will be limited to certain rangers authorised by the Director-General of Conservation, but other full-time rangers will have the ability to temporarily stop suspected offenders in order to allow an investigation. They will be able to seize a broader range of evidence that they currently at the moment cannot. So they will be able to require identification and details from suspected offenders. The range of powers that allow these offenders to be stopped is: to be stopped, identified, investigated, and in certain circumstances arrested, also then leading to prosecution. These powers, to me, as part of the Local Government and Environment Committee, are well-thought-out, they are sensible, and they carefully balance the operational requirements of DOC staff with the principle that agents of the Government should have no more power than they need in order to carry out their job.</p><p class="a">In this case, this bill is an excellent bill. It is a reflection of the great work that has been done under this Government in the name of conservation. I acknowledge once again the Minister of Conservation in being the one who actually really is responsible for this bill coming to the House, and it is our pleasure to be sitting on the committee to assist in enabling that to happen. I have no hesitation in commending this bill to the House. Kia ora.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 11:05:44" ></a><strong>Hon RUTH DYSON (Labour—Port Hills)</strong>: I am delighted to join the voices of support for the second reading of the Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill, and I want to particularly congratulate the Local Government and Environment Committee on the work that it did—very ably chaired by a member whose name just escapes me at the moment.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Members</strong>: Oh!</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon RUTH DYSON</strong>: Scott Simpson, an excellent chair of the committee. I think the whole committee seems to have done a very good job on this. </p><p class="a">This bill was certainly necessary. It is not a very big bill, it is not a very substantial bill, it has not got a lot of policy issues in it, but it was needed to update the powers that Department of Conservation (DOC) officers have. The main new power that is given in this bill is the power to seize a wider range of evidence. That is clearly to ensure that any prosecution has a more robust case behind it so that it does not fail. That is a smart thing to do. There is the power to stop a person—it might seem like that must be the case at the moment, but, actually, under the current Wildlife Act, rangers have powers to stop only vehicles, vessels, and other items. For example, if someone is carrying a bag, rangers can detain the bag but they cannot detain the person, so that obviously makes examination, calling the police, etc., a lot more difficult. </p><p class="a">Currently rangers cannot temporarily stop people to assist in an investigation. So, obviously, if someone is doing something that is considered illegal they can just leave and, again, the rangers have no ability to stop them. If the rangers think that a person might have been a witness to such an offence, they cannot stop them either. They cannot seize evidence. They cannot seize cameras, they cannot seize mobile phones, and they cannot seize laptops. I think that the original legislation was passed before laptops and mobile phones were in use—it is 1953 legislation, so it is getting on. We did not have mobile phones and laptops, so I am told, in those days. </p><p class="a">Another new power that is being given by this legislation is the power to require suspected offenders to supply identification details. Obviously, that is another critical bit of information that would enable a successful prosecution to later go through. In some specific examples there are warranted rangers and approved officers who would actually themselves have the power of arrest. So those are the main additional powers that are being given to all DOC rangers and some specifically warranted rangers and approved officers in terms of the power of arrest. </p><p class="a">Labour supports any measure that will help our hard-working Conservation staff do their jobs properly. I do not think there would be very many New Zealanders who do not totally value the work that DOC does. It will be a good message for DOC staff to hear from this Parliament that their work is appreciated, because we know that they do not feel very valued. They do not feel as if they are properly supported to get on and do their job. The Department of Conservation does an annual survey, and the 2015 results showed that only 27 percent of DOC staff had faith and confidence in their senior leadership, which is a really sad reflection on how people whom we in this Parliament value so much regard the support that they are given. </p><p class="a">We know that our natural environment is not just good for New Zealanders to love and value but is also a massive asset for our country for recreation as well as tourism. People come to New Zealand because of the beautiful environment that we have and, of course, because of the welcoming people as well. So we have to ensure that that environment is protected for future generations. We have a responsibility as parliamentarians to ensure that that protection is properly funded and properly supported. </p><p class="a">We know that DOC has been struggling with funding over the last little while. I know that under the previous Minister there were substantial cuts to the DOC budget. The Minister came to a select committee that I was on and explained the reason for the cuts, and basically said: "You know, we haven't enough money to go round and DOC has to have its share of the cuts in the same way as other Government departments and agencies have done." That was his explanation. It was not well received, I know, by the committee at the time, because DOC is funded to only the bare minimum now, and it cannot really afford to face any more cuts. </p><p class="a">We know that DOC staff, as I mentioned earlier, feel undervalued and they are also overworked. Last year 1,500 DOC staff took industrial action, and they were offered a pitiful pay increase. They felt as if it was a slap in the face, given all the work that they had done. In this legislation we are giving them additional work, and what would be really great to hear—and I am sure that DOC staff would welcome it—is that they are getting additional resources. They are getting all these additional powers. There will be more work when the Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill is passed, but where are the resources to back it up? </p><p class="a">In 2009 there were 803 DOC rangers—that is public information; it cannot be argued because it is information that is on the public record—and now there are only 637. Again, that is information that is on the public record. There has been no change in the names of the rangers. There can be no explanations such as: "They are now called something else." They were rangers then and they are rangers now, and the number has reduced substantially. Again, in this bill we are giving those very people more work to do. It is the DOC rangers who are going to be asked to do this work. </p><p class="a">In 2009 the DOC budget was cut by $46 million. That was done by the previous Minister, and I have already explained the reasons he gave to the select committee for that cut. In 2013 it was cut by another $8.7 million. I want to know whether, in the next Budget, the addition work we are giving the rangers will be properly resourced. We should not be setting up public servants to fail. That is a very bad thing for this Government to do, and it is a bad thing for this Parliament to do. So although we support the intent of this legislation, and we will certainly be voting for it, I suppose the message to the Minister is: "Put your money where your mouth is." Let us see the resources so that we can be confident that this legislation will be enacted in the way that Parliament has intended, in the way the select committee discussed in its careful deliberations, and in the way, I am sure, the Minister originally intended. Thank you.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 11:13:13" ></a><strong>MATT DOOCEY (National—Waimakariri)</strong>: It is a pleasure and an honour to rise in support of the Wildlife (Powers) Amendment Bill in its second reading. Could I acknowledge the Hon Maggie Barry, our Minister of Conservation, for all the great work she does and the ambitious work she and the Government do in ensuring we protect our wildlife.</p><p class="a">We know that with New Zealand's culture and economy our wildlife and our environment are a key part of that. It is something we should always be looking to protect, and it is great to see that this National Government, with its Bluegreen initiatives, is the party that is very much looking to protect our environment and protect our wildlife. A lot of constituents in my electorate say to me: "Why does the Green Party always default to far-left socialist policies? Why does it not get back to talking about the environment?". Well, I suppose we have probably taken that space of talking about the environment, championing the environment, and championing the wildlife. I mean, when you look at the great wildlife we have, whether it be our kiwi, our tuatara—I am a big fan, being from Canterbury, of course, of our cheeky kea. It is a great bird.</p><p class="a">The benefits of being an open country and connecting to a globalised world actually come with some risks and some threats. We know that in the days of the internet, as well as more accessible airline travel, this poses some risks from people who might choose to shop online for some of our wildlife, or who come over here to smuggle some of our wildlife back to another country. So it is quite right that we are taking a very keen interest in this space, and quite right that we have actually listened to Department of Conservation (DOC) staff. This bill is actually based on the feedback from DOC staff, and it is great that the Government is looking to empower them further to achieve their jobs. Their feedback was that they have not been able to seize devices storing evidence, such as cameras and phones. They were having a bigger issue around people providing false names and addresses and not being able to ask them to provide some proof of ID, and they have had an inability to stop people for a reasonable period of time. So that is what this bill seeks to address, and I feel, after going through the select committee process, we have gone some way towards achieving that outcome.</p><p class="a">The bill comes back from the Local Government and Environment Committee in pretty good shape. It has gone through the submission process. I think we had seven submissions overall. Every submission was favourable to the intent of the bill and supported it, although there were some concerns. We have looked at them and pretty much looked at putting them into the amendments, and some of the amendments I would like to talk about today in this second reading.</p><p class="a">The first one is around new section 39A in clause 5. There was a lot of discussion around extending the powers of rangers to seize evidential material. I suppose when we give people those powers to seize items, we should always ensure that it is proportionate and reasonable, and I feel where new section 39A has landed—it comes back into the House for its second reading, and it clarifies this to be proportionate and reasonable.</p><p class="a">New section 39B in clause 5 amends powers to stop someone when investigating a suspected offence, and very much when we were looking at this we wondered whether we should be putting in something around a time frame for stopping someone. We found that that could not be defined, but what this amendment to new section 39B does is it comes back in clarifying that this section does not intend to give the power to physically stop someone. So it is not the physicality of stopping someone, but more just to direct or require them.</p><p class="a">New section 39C in clause 5 looks to give reasonable grounds, where a person is committing or is about to commit an offence, for the necessary person to prevent or stop the offender. There was a lot of discussion at the select committee stage about what we are doing here, and whether we are actually going to be giving a new power to give people the right to go on to private property. It was something that we were a bit concerned about, but our amendment clarifies that it does not give the person—or a ranger, in this case—the right to go on to private property.</p><p class="a">Just finally, around new section 39D in clause 5, what we are looking for is around clarity of arrest: are we saying it gives all professionals, in this case, the ability to arrest, or, rather, to just detain someone and wait for a constable to arrive and arrest the detained person? Where we have landed for this is that it just clarifies the ability for the ranger to have those powers as well. So, overall, it is a pretty good bill that has come back in good shape from the select committee, and I commend it to the House.</p><p class="IndentMarginalone">Bill read a second time.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="MarginHeading"><strong>Parts 1 to 28, schedules 1 and 2, and clauses 1 and 2</strong></p><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 11:20:10" ></a><strong>KRIS FAAFOI (Labour—Mana)</strong>: I have been waiting for some time to speak at the Committee stage of the Statutes Amendment Bill. In my first contribution I want to draw on two Supplementary Order Papers on this bill that are on the Table: one under my name, Supplementary Order Paper 191, and Supplementary Order Paper 207 in the name of the ACT leader, David Seymour. In essence, those two Supplementary Order Papers (SOPs) are offering the ability for the Government to have a "get out of jail free" card, because my SOP looks to insert something in the bill that I think is non-controversial and something that most parties would agree to. It is not a massive departure from policy or a large policy issue that would require the debate in a separate piece of legislation. </p><p class="a">Unfortunately for this Committee, the contents of my Supplementary Order Paper are contained in another piece of legislation, a member's bill in the name of Nuk Korako, a National list MP. It essentially looks to amend the Airport Authorities Act 1966 to allow airport authorities or airports to advertise in mediums other than the newspaper when they want to sell luggage that has been lost or left at airports. Just to clarify, the law does need to be changed, because at the moment the Act as it stands allows airports to advertise the sale of lost luggage that they are now taking responsibility for only by way of a newspaper advertisement. </p><p class="a">This change, contained in Mr Korako's bill and also within SOP 191, would not change the world entirely—I know you should not say that when it is your own SOP—but it would save this House, this Parliament, and the taxpayer a significant amount of money. When Mr Korako had his bill pulled from the ballot he said at the time that it was an issue that had been raised with him, as someone who was a member of Parliament, in and around his daily work engaging with the industry. </p><p class="a">At that time I think I had been the spokesperson on tourism for the Opposition for around about 4 or 5 months, and I think I took a pretty aggressive approach to making sure that I was engaging with stakeholders, including Christchurch Airport, the local airport of Mr Korako. But not once was the issue of advertising sales of lost luggage raised with me—not by Christchurch Airport; not by Queenstown Airport; not by Wellington Airport, my local airport; not during the extensive visit to Auckland Airport, both domestic and international, which I had the pleasure of visiting; and not by Air New Zealand, which I spent a complete day with, getting to know the operation. So I think Mr Korako's assertion that this is a major issue for the likes of airports or airlines is slightly—and I am been slightly diplomatic—wide of the mark. </p><p class="a">So in an effort to try to save some time of this Committee, I think this is a perfect opportunity—through the Statutes Amendment Bill—to address the issue, this great gap in our tourism sector that Mr Korako thinks is so important that he thinks it is worthy of a member's bill in the ballot. My SOP, SOP 191, would essentially do everything that Mr Korako's bill, which is before the House as a member's bill, after being pulled from the ballot, would do. </p><p class="a">So if an airport found itself overwhelmed with a quantity of luggage that it thought it needed to offload, my SOP would allow Christchurch Airport—to give an example from Mr Korako's own patch—to advertise in other than the Christchurch Press<em> </em>that it was going to have a sale of lost luggage. It would also allow Christchurch Airport to advertise online and in other modes of communication. I guess that would also open up the option of radio advertising. I am not sure whether Mr Korako has thought about that. It may be that that is something he could raise at the select committee if my SOP does not get through. </p><p class="a">I am being a little bit tongue-in-cheek here, but a Statutes Amendment Bill is a great way—it is a way that we are currently using—to tidy up legislation and to make sure that things that are not controversial do not take up the time of this House. I think the fact that this SOP had to be brought to this Committee—there is another SOP in the name of David Seymour, and I am sure he will be down at some stage to talk to it—means the issue should have been included in a Statutes Amendment Bill, which speaks to the point that I believe that the member's bill ballot process in Parliament is being abused by the Government.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: Yep.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>KRIS FAAFOI</strong>: It is. For people at home who do not know how the member's bill ballot operates, it is a little bit like Lotto. Members of this House who are not members of the executive, I understand, get to put a piece of legislation that they feel very passionate about—it could be a local issue—into the ballot. Every so often we have a draw, and if your bill is drawn from the ballot, then it possibly may get debated in this House. I think that process should be used for bills that are worthy of the time of this House. </p><p class="a">Quite bluntly, advertising lost luggage by any means other than the newspaper should not take up a first reading, should not take up a select committee process, should not take up a second reading, should not take up a Committee stage, and should not take up third reading time in this House. Mr Korako's bill will cost taxpayers thousands of dollars, if not tens of thousands of dollars, potentially creeping up to $100,000. We have at the moment a situation where services in our country are struggling for funding, yet this Government and that particular member think that this issue is such a big issue it should be debated and go through the complete legislative process in the House. I also think the Government knows it has got it wrong, because Gerry Brownlee at one stage tried to have it pass through all stages in an attempt to save face.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: It didn't work.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>KRIS FAAFOI</strong>: It did not work. I am not sure that this is going to work, because I believe also that any member of this House—and maybe I should not tell New Zealand First this—can object to my SOP and then it is off the Table and it will not happen. But I think we should try to save those tens of thousands of dollars and the time of this House, respect the process of a members' ballot, and not have ballots for that sort of legislation anymore. So we could do away with that in Mr Korako's case. We can also do away with it in the case of Mr Seymour's SOP, which, I believe, will streamline the process for a bill under the name of Matthew Doocey. </p><p class="a">So I guess the ball is now in the Government's court and also in New Zealand First's court if they actually want to save the taxpayer some money. There are two SOPs—two of the three that are now on the Table—that will potentially save a couple of hundred thousand dollars and a lot of time in terms of the processes of select committees, where issues that New Zealanders really care about could be discussed and debated, and we could progress through this Parliament inquiries or legislation that will make a difference to the people of New Zealand. </p><p class="a">Advertising the sale of lost luggage is not on anyone else's radar other than Nuk Korako's. I want to know from Mr Korako where this issue came from, because I think there would possibly be one or two people—Mr Korako's executive assistants, who have probably had to wade through quite a bit of research because of this—who are actually concerned about this issue.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 11:30:20" ></a><strong>Hon RUTH DYSON (Labour—Port Hills)</strong>: I am delighted to speak on the Statutes Amendment Bill, but I regret that I have to start my contribution by correcting my colleague. I totally support his Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) 191, which inserts into the Statutes Amendment Bill the Airport Authorities Act 1966 alteration. But the bill that he is trying to get off our Order Paper in order to save the taxpayer thousands and thousands of dollars, and Parliament hours and hours of time, is not about lost luggage.</p><p class="a">The airline companies themselves deal with lost luggage. If you are flying Air New Zealand, and you arrive in Auckland and they say "Welcome to Auckland, Mr Faafoi. Your bag is in Invercargill.", Air New Zealand will get your bag from Invercargill to Auckland for you, because that is what they do when they accept you putting in your bag at check in. This bill—</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Sarah Dowie</strong>: They don't lose it from Invercargill.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon RUTH DYSON</strong>: Yes, it is.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Sarah Dowie</strong>: No, they don't. They don't lose it at Invercargill.</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon RUTH DYSON</strong>: Oh, sorry. Sarah Dowie has just offered to collect your bag from Invercargill airport, Mr Faafoi, and take it to you. She is a generous young woman.</p><p class="Interjection"><strong>Kris Faafoi</strong>: What's it doing in Invercargill?</p><p class="ContinueSpeech"><strong>Hon RUTH </strong><strong>DYSON</strong>: Ha! So the member's bill that is going to waste hours of time, which should be in this Statutes Amendment Bill, is about lost property. If you leave your comb or your book or your pen at the cafe or somewhere else within the airport, that is what this deals with. It is not just insignificant because it deals with lost luggage; it is even more insignificant because it does not even deal with lost luggage.</p><p class="a">I want to go back the point of statutes amendment bills. It is a very unusual process, and one that I think as a Parliament we should really value. The point of a statutes amendment bill is to make changes. It is an omnibus bill because there are a whole lot of Acts that are changed, but each change to each different Act has to be minor, it has to be technical, and it has to be non-controversial. That is the point of a statutes amendment bill. Although Parliament takes a lot of effort, particularly at Committee stage, to ensure that the details of the bill that we are considering are right; often we get it wrong. A statutes amendment bill gives us the opportunity to correct a drafting error or an inconsistency, so that the law reads as it was intended. That is the point of a statutes amendment bill, and those are the criteria that it has to meet.</p><p class="a">As members will have noted in our second reading, which I will just briefly refer to, some of the provisions in the original legislation did not meet those criteria, and we peeled them off as separate bills during the debate. So it is now the opportunity for the Committee of the whole House to go through that same deliberation and make sure that the 26 bills that we are proposing to amend in this Statutes Amendment Bill are indeed correct and that we have got it right.</p><p class="a">We should not confuse this statutes amendment process with statutes repeal, which has quite different criteria. A bill recently went through the House that actually repealed an Act. So statutes repeal actually repeals an entire Act, presumably because it is redundant, but the criteria seem to be looser than for statutes amendment, and I think that is something that the Standing Orders Committee might like to look at. I do not think it is appropriate, for example, for a statutes repeal bill to be used to take away a piece of legislation because the current Government does not like it.</p><p class="a">We have got a process for that, and in my view it should not be a statutes repeal bill. I refer to the Supplementary Order Paper 191 of Kris Faafoi, even though he exaggerated the scope of his SOP and of the member's bill that it seeks to replace. I also want to commend the Supplementary Order Paper 207 of David Seymour. That is not a move that I take very often in debates in this House. David Seymour is actually doing exactly the same thing as Kris Faafoi, but on a different bill. He is proposing that nonsense legislation—the time-wasting and money-wasting legislation of Matt Doocey—is replaced by a Supplementary Order Paper. I hope that the member has noticed that yet again, twice in one week, I am commending something that he has done. This is a bit of a risk to both our reputations, but the member David Seymour's Supplementary Order Paper would save the taxpayers a lot of money.</p></div></body>

							<body  ><div class="section"><p class="Speech"><a name="time_20161103 11:35:21" ></a><strong>DAVID SEYMOUR (Leader—ACT)</strong>: I would just like to commend the member Ruth Dyson on her commendation, but I think for both our interests, reputations, and future career prospects, we should try not to make a habit of it.</p><p class="a">I would like to speak to a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) that I have on the Table in my name. It is Supplementary Order Paper 207, and it is really quite a simple thing. At the heart of it, it amends the Companies Act so that companies are able to send out their annual reports in an electronic format rather than a paper format. It is a very simple thing.</p><p class="a">I do actually want to just pay a tribute to Matt Doocey, who has been much maligned for introducing this member's bill, because he did use the members' ballot for the purpose it was designed. He is an electorate MP. He had feedback from business people in his electorate, who said: "We have to send out these reports in paper format. The cost is killing us. The environmental impacts are highly negative, when we know that 90 percent of the business—when we do our banking, when we take our orders, when we do our commerce—we do electronically. It is absolutely archaic that the Companies Act requires us to send out a paper format report every year and upon request." So Matt Doocey was doing the right thing.</p><p class="a">But I think—as others have commented—it costs $43,000 an hour to operate this House, on an average cost basis, and it was a very large use of this House's time and, therefore, taxpayers' money to make such a minor amendment through the whole member's bill process. Thankfully, one of the things I can say as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister for Regulatory Reform is that I am very pleased that this Government does, from time to time, have a statutes repeal bill, a statutes amendment bill, and a Regulatory Systems Bill—bills that are designed to clean up the many aspects of the 40 books of statutes that this Parliament has passed in the last 170 years or so, to reform those many aspects where they are an impediment to people going about their lives in an efficient way.</p><p class="a">This SOP is not a complex one. If you go through the various sections, it amends the Companies Act. Wherever there is a requirement for a company to send out a paper statement, it is replaced with the option of sending out an electronic statement. It requires a company, in the first instance, to notify a shareholder or somebody who is entitled to receive such a document that they have a choice, and then that person must make an election either to continue receiving paper or to receive their documents in electronic format. If the person fails to make that election, then the company no longer has an obligation to furnish them with a paper statement. If they elect to have electronic statements, then they will receive this correspondence in an electronic format for the rest of their association with that company. That is a very small thing this Government can do, taking up a small amount of the House's time in order to make it easier for people to go about their business, build their companies, and actually create wealth and opportunity for New Zealanders up and down this country.</p><p class="a">I think, Mr Chair, you are probably detecting that I have actually spoken as much as one can speak on this. I am very pleased to see the House considering this SOP, and I hope that all members will consider supporting it. It should be non-controversial.
